Let me see (let me see)
How my life has been (taken) taken.
This demon (haunts me) haunts me.
They're waiting (help me) help me.

You fuck me up
I'm gagged & bound.
You pick me up
When I am down.
I can not live without them.
I do not live without them.

Hey Daddy (Daddy)
They are taking me (away)
Putting
Things in me (what soul)
My soul
They're eating
Please help me.

You fuck me up
I'm gagged & bound.
You pick me up
When I am down.
I can not live without them
I do not live without them.

They tell me this thing inside of me
Wants to get out.
All it does is scream and shout.
I'm trying not to let them out.
They tell me to hurt myself.
They tell me to hurt myself.
They tell me to hurt myself.
But I am not gonna listen.

You fuck me up
I'm gagged & bound.
You pick me up
When I am down.
I can not live without them.
I do not live without them.

You fuck me up (Hey Daddy)
I'm gagged & bound.
You pick me up (They are)
When I am down.
I can not live without them. (Taking me)
I do not live without them. (This demon)

(Daddy)
Hey Daddy
Hey Daddy
(waiting)
Hey Daddy
(waiting)
