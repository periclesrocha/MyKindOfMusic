Your the infection, my friend
Disgusting right to the end
Didn't I know it then?
I knew it, I knew it
You're basic but hard to define
Simple yet somehow sublime
Know you will strike again
I knew it, I knew it

You're all that's wrong with your dumbass song
Yeah, that's all that you will ever be
Nothing you can do 'cause that's all that you will ever be

Polished, you shimmer when shined, but rotten and seething inside
Everyone falls for this
I knew it, I knew it

You're all that's wrong with your dumbass song
Yeah, that's all that you will ever be
Nothing you can do 'cause that's all that you will, it's all that you will, it's all that you will ever be

Ever be, never be, want to be mine
All to be, made to be, holding your side
Throwing it, breaking it over your grave
Sending you back to the place you once came
It would be hard to be you, knowing the right thing to do

You're all that's wrong with your dumbass song
Yeah, that's all that you will ever be
Nothing you can do 'cause that's all that you will ever be

Ever be, never be, wannabe
Ever be, never be, wannabe
Ever be, never be, wannabe
Ever be, never be, wannabe
You will never be, you will never be, you will never be
You don't wanna be gone, you don't wanna be gone, you don't wanna be gone
It's all gone, it's all gone, it's all gone, it's all gone
(Gone)
It's all gone, it's all gone
Ever be, never be, wannabe
