Must you keep looking at me
Before you looked the other way.
Must you keep glaring at me
I know you look inside, and see what you made.

You took no pride in me
But now I'm your everything
It's finding out ya own(owe?) me
Not all of your gloating.

Must you keep looking at me.
Now you see what I am.
Trust, I knew what it was.
I don't forget things, thinking I'm nothing.

You took no pride in me
But now I'm your everything
It's finding out ya own(owe?) me
Not all of your gloating.

Pride of me
No Pride
Why (x7)

Must you keep looking at me
Before you looked the other way
Trust, I knew what it was
I don't forget things, look what you've made.

You took no pride in me
But now I'm your everything
It's finding out ya own(owe?) me
Not all of your gloating.
