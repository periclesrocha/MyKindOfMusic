In your little white wicker chair
Unsuspicious, nobody cares for you
You're so fucked up again

You laugh at nothin' in the pouring rain
You try to tell yourself you're not insane
You fool, I hate you sometimes

Hey
You know it ain't coincidental that you're lost in place
It's drippin' off your face
And you're losin' your precious mind

But send me a postcard if you get that far
You got a couple pennies in your rusty jar
The truth, you've been gone for awhile

And it's hard lookin' at you when you look that way
With your one night stands and your sleep all days
Ooh, you're such a slut sometimes

But hey
You know it ain't coincidental that you're lost in place
It's drippin' off your face
And you're losin' your precious mind

You're losin' your mind
You're losin' your mind
You're losin' your mind

I said you're losin' your mind
You're losin' your mind
You're losin' your mind
I said you're losin' your mind
You're losin' your mind
You're losin' your mind
I said you're losin' your mind
You're losin' your mind
You're losin' your mind
