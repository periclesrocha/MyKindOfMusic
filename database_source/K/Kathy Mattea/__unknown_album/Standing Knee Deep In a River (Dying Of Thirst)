Friends I could count on, I could count on one hand
With a leftover finger or two
I took 'em for granted, let 'em all slip away
Now where they are I wish I knew

They roll by just like water
And I guess we never learn
Go through life parched and empty
Standing knee deep in a river and dying of thirst

Sometimes I remember sweethearts I've known
Some I've forgotten I suppose
One or two still linger, oh, and I wonder now
Why I ever let them go?

They roll by just like water
And I guess we never learn
Go through life parched and empty
Standing knee deep in a river and dying of thirst

So the sidewalk is crowded, the city goes by
And I rush through another day
And a world full of strangers turn their eyes to me
But I just look the other way

They roll by just like water
And I guess we never learn
Go through life parched and empty
Standing knee deep in a river and dying of thirst

They roll by just like water
And I guess we never learn
Go through life parched and empty
Standing knee deep in a river and dying of thirst
