Oh darlin', My deer,
Please let me hold you near.
You've waited long time.
While I made up my mind
I can't believe...
That you are still there for me.

I stumbled; I fell.
And now I'm here to tell you.
I need you, right now.
I'll stay and we can work it out.
I can't believe, that you're still there for me.

You kept on forgiving me. You gave me everything...
I know now, I'm sure
My heart has found a cure.
I'm ready; I'm strong. But you knew that all along.

I can't believe, that you're still there for me.
Oh darlin', My deer,
Please let me hold you near.
This is where I'm at.
I'm going to learn how to love like that.

I can't believe, that you're still there for me.
I can't believe, that you're still there for me.
