"My Mother Was Obsessed By Evil Jealousy
She Didn't Want Nobody To Even Look At Molly
She Kept Me Locked Up In This Attic 'Till I Died
Only 4 Years Old, My Story Left Untold"
Oh Molly...Oh Molly

"Mother Was Struck By This Infallible Idea
If She Could Paint My Portrait I Would Remain Immortal
And I Could Hang Downstairs Above The Fireplace
A Little Girl In Lace, Not A Single Trace Of Crime"
Solo: Andy
"Each day And Night She Worked And Autumn Turned To Spring
For Every Stroke She Painted A Little Life Was Ended
At Last I Felt So Weak I Could Not Even Speak
But In That Fatal Portrait My Spirit Came To Lfe Again"

Oh Molly
Solo: Mike - Theme: Mike
"That Night I Made The Portrait Speak In Evil Tongue:
You're Gonna Go Beyond Too, May Pain And Death Bestow You
She Grabbed A Book And Spoke Aloud An Ancient Rhyme
While She Burned The Portrait In The Candle Of Fate"
Oh Molly

"I've Gotta Se Ma"
