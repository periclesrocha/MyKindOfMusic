The night is rising my eyes
Even in the dark I know i'm alive

I am burning for you,
Yeah you know its true.

Voices are calling in the night
Breaking the changing sleep of night
I see your face i can't deny it
Darkness you are a holy shrine

The night, awake us tonight
This is where we all meet
The ones left behind

I am burning for you,
Yeah you know it's true.

Voices are calling in the night
Breaking the changing sleep of night
I see your face i can't deny it
Darkness you are a holy shrine

[Solo]

Voices are calling in the night
Breaking the changing sleep of night
I see your face i can't deny it
Darkness you are a holy shrine

The night, awake us tonight
This is where we all meet
The ones left behind

I am burning for you,
Yeah you know it's true.

Voices are calling in the night
Breaking the changing sleep of night
I see your face i can't deny it
Darkness you are a holy shrine

I am burning for you... I am burning for you...

[Solo]
