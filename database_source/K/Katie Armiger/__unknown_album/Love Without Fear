Love Without Fear

I see myself in your eyes
And suddenly there's nothing left for me to hide
I used to be so scared of this
And now you've gone and changed it all with just a kiss

I held back
But you held on
Now we have everything we'll ever want

Chorus:
A love without fences
A love without walls
A love where we're taking
And giving it all
A love without limits
Where we can be free
To follow our hearts
Wherever they lead

Baby that's why were here
To love without fear

I lose myself in your touch
And finally I find that I am strong enough
To listen to this voice within
Telling me to throw all caution to the wind

My heart beats like thunder
And I am not afraid
'Cause baby you showed me the way

Chorus:
A love without fences
A love without walls
A love where we're taking
And giving it all
A love without limits
Where we can be free
To follow our hearts
Wherever they lead

Baby that's why were here
To love without fear
