I just pulled out of Minneapolis and I aimed my headlights south
Got the taste of cherry lipstick still a clinging to my mouth
She begged me not to leave her and she cried till I nearly stayed
But I glanced at that old roadmap and she just didn't make the grade
There wasn't nothing wrong with her lovin'
She just ain't got what they got down in Biloxi
I got a doll in Pascadola I got a jewel in Gulf Port
And both of them more warm blooded that any woman I've made up north
And it's a cajun queen in Creole she must be six feet tall
When she starts lovin' now you just gonna climb up the wall
Ain't nothin' against the other states they just ain't got what they got down in Biloxi
[ dobro ]
When I reach the city limits I'm gonna stop upon the bluff
Nonchalantly get naked and go swimming in the gulf
Wash the north all off of me when I feel like it's done
I'm gonna crawl up on a rock and soak up all that southern sun
The sun shines in Minnesota but it don't shine like it do down in Biloxi
[ guitar + steel ]
Then I'm going to missing persons I'm gonna turn my body in
And beg the police to shoot me if I try to leave again
Cause friend I've been all over and even looking at it from the worst
It's still stands out as bein' about the finest place on earth
I think a chunk of heaven must have fell down on the spot they call Biloxi
Yeah this old country boy's goin' home to Biloxi
