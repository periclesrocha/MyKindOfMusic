Tried to say I'm sorry
I didn't mean to break your heart
And find you waitin' up by the light of day

There's a lot I want to tell you
But I don't know where to start
And I don't know what I'd do if you walked away

Ooh, baby I tried to make it
I just got lost along the way

But, every time I look at you
No matter what I'm goin' through
It's easy to see
And every time I hold you
The things I never told you
Seem to come easily
'Cause you're everything to me, yeah

I never really wanted
To let you get inside my heart
I wanted to believe this would soon be ending

I thought it wouldn't matter
If it all just came apart
But now I realize I was just pretending

Ooh baby, I know I hurt you
But you can still believe in me

'Cause, every time I look at you
No matter what I'm goin' through
It's easy to see
And every time I hold you
The things I never told you
Seem to come easily,
'Cause your everything to me

It's gonna take a little time to show you
Just what you mean to me, oh yeah
It seems the more I get to know you
The more I need to make you see
You're everything I need, yeah

Wooh
I need ya, I need ya, I need ya, I need ya, yeah yeah

Woah, baby baby baby, I know I hurt you
But you can still believe in me

'Cause, every time I look at you
No matter what I'm goin' through
It's easy to see
And every time I hold you
The things I never told you
Seems to come easily
'Cause your every thing to me

You're everything to me
You're everything to me
