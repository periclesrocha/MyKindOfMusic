Anything, see
Anything I
Only wanna
See your lips move slow

Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down

I can see you
It’s revision
Dancing body
In the afterglow

Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down

Anything do
Anything I
Only wanna
Feel your spirit move

Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down

I’ve been searching
Corners of the nighttime
Baby
Where did you get to?

Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down

I hear they say
“Lucifer rising”
Strange kiss you bring
Lucifer rising

Perfect skin
You’re fitting in
I
Betcha make the sunshine feel shy

Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down

Everybody
Loves you baby
Everybody
Wants you — so do I

Down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down

I hear they say
“Lucifer rising”
Strange kiss you bring
Lucifer rising

Ram me through nights
Our summer
With flowers in our hair
Paradise is ours to share

I hear they say
“Lucifer rising”
Strange kiss you bring
Lucifer rising

I hear they say
“Lucifer rising”
Strange kiss you bring
Lucifer rising

Rising…

Lucifer rising…

Strange
