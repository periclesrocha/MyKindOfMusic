Baby we’ve been playing with fire
Turning on a record desire
Baby we’ve been playing with fire

Baby if you come out tonight
We can make you feel alright
Baby if you come out tonight

Look in my bedroom
I painted it red
I hung up your picture
Right over my bed
I know every word you ever said

Blonde hair, blue eyes and
We’re dreaming of you now baby (you now baby)
Don’t care
Your wild heart (wild heart)
Is gonna see us through now baby (through now baby)

Baby we’ve been playing with fire
Turning on a record desire
Baby we’ve been playing with fire

My favourite scene ends
I play it again
I like to freeze frame when you’re laughing
Man I’d kill to be your friend

Blonde hair, blue eyes and
We’re dreaming with you now baby (you now baby)
Don’t care
Your wild heart (wild heart)
Is gonna see us through now baby (through now baby)

A-aah-ah (a-aah)
A-aah (a-aah-ah-ah)
A-aah-ah (a-aah)
A-aah (a-aah-ah-ah)

Blonde hair, blue eyes and
We’re dreaming with you now baby (you now baby)
Don’t care
Your wild heart (wild heart)
Is gonna get us through now baby (through now baby)

Blonde hair, blue eyes and
We’re dreaming with you now baby (you now baby)
Don’t care
Your wild heart (wild heart)
Is gonna see us through now baby (through now baby)
