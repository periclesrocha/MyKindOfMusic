This Halloween I think that we should be together
Just for old time's sake
I wanna hear you scream just like
You used to when we were only thirteen

Now the candle's burning out
And the pumpkin's rotting away
I just want you here beside me
On this lonesome Halloween day

Sitting in the dark
Drinking my own blood
And a voice, it whispers, "Hello my love"

Haunt me, haunt me like you used to
Won't you scare me, oh
Haunt me, haunt me like you used to
I love you best when you scare me to death

I'm laying in our bed with these
Tainted sheets pulled right over my head
I'm singing all our favorite songs out loud
And I'm hoping you can hear them somehow

Now the candle's burning out
And the pumpkin's rotting away
I just want you here beside me
On this lonesome Halloween day

Sitting in the dark
Drinking my own blood
And a voice, it whispers, "Hello my love"

Haunt me, haunt me like you used to
Won't you scare me, oh
Haunt me, haunt me like you used to
I love you best when you scare me to death

Haunt me, haunt me like you used to
Won't you scare me, oh
Haunt me, haunt me like you used to
I love you best when you scare me to death

Every word you said, it ricochets
Just like a bullet in my head
I wish that you could see that our love
Is bringing out the dead in me

Now the candle's burning out
And the pumpkin's rotting away
I just want you here beside me
On this lonesome Halloween day

Sitting in the dark
Drinking my own blood
And a voice, it whispers, "Hello my love"

Haunt me, haunt me like you used to
Won't you scare me, oh
Haunt me, haunt me like you used to
I love you best when you scare me to death

Haunt me, haunt me like you used to
Won't you scare me, oh
Haunt me, haunt me like you used to
I love you best when you scare me to death
