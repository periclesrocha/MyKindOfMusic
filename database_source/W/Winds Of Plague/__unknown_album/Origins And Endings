It begins when the time comes in
And brings forth a dead current
A motion set for certain demise

We watched them come from the depths
But we couldn't see it till we looked in their eyes
Behind the mask, the demon resides
The meat was stripped from their bones

We destroy!

Burn it all down
Put them back underground
This is a day that I promise
You will not forget

With the heart of a warrior,
I rise with all I have left

I watched as the walls crumbled backed
Backed with a burning sky, legions fell
They left with a mission complete
Genocide fulfilled; leave me for dead

Miscreation of revenge beats through my veins
Empires that once rivaled us fell from the sky
Beg for life as you return to the Earth

The world will bow to me
