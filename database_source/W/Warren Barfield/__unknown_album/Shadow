I know my shady little shadow
Would've left me long ago
If he wasn't tied to my feet
He's always been a scared one
Turn off the lights and he runs
Nowhere to be seen

I am lonely only when I'm alone

I need more than a shadow
Someone that won't go
Whenever life grows dark
You're the only one I know
Whose love never lets go
We'll never be apart
Never be apart

You and me, we've got a good thing
We move so smoothly
You lead and I will follow
You're closer than a brother
I'm a book, You're the cover
You surround my soul

With You only my lonely is gone

You're so much more than a shadow
Someone that won't go
Whenever life grows dark
You're the only one I know
Whose love never lets go
We'll never be apart

Never be apart
You eclipse my heart
