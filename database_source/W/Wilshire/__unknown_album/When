Oh, you've seen it all and more
Words are just words
And you've heard them before

You feel you can't go on this way
It's hard to recognize the stranger
In your mirror

Ooh, you're jaded beyond your years
And you've come undone
Waiting for the sun, oh yeah

And when a friend cannot be found
When the world just wants to drag you down
Like a slow weight tumbling to the ground, hold on

Oh, it's too much to bear
Look around, look around, tears are falling everywhere
At the end of the day we all feel the same, oh yeah

And when a friend cannot be found
When the world just wants to drag you down
Like a slow weight tumbling to the ground, hold on

When you're sure you've had all you can take
When you feel your heart begin to break
When it's easier to throw it all away, hold on

Oh yeah, and when a friend cannot be found
When the world just wants to drag you down
Like a slow weight tumbling to the ground, hold on

When you're sure you've had all you can take
When you feel your heart begin to break
When it's easier to throw it all away, hold on, oh yeah, oh
