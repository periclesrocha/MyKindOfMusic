Ridin’ in the bus down the boulevard
And the place was pretty packed (yeah)
Couldn’t find a seat so I had to stand
With the perverts in the back
It was smellin’ like a locker room
There was junk all over the floor
We’re already packed in like sardines
But we’re stoppin’ to pick up more, look out!

Another one rides the bus
Another one rides the bus
Another comes on, and another comes on
Another one rides the bus
Hey, he’s gonna sit by you
Another one rides the bus

There’s a suitcase pokin’ me in the ribs
There’s an elbow in my ear
There’s a smelly old bum standin’ next to me
Hasn’t showered in a year
I think I’m missin’ a contact lens
I think my wallet’s gone
And I think this bus is stoppin’ again
To let a couple more freaks get on, look out!

Another one rides the bus
Another one rides the bus
Another comes on, and another comes on
Another one rides the bus
Hey, he’s gonna sit by you
Another one rides the bus

Yeah, another one rides the bus
Another one rides the bus ow!
Another one rides the bus, hey-hey
Another one rides the bus, hey-hey-hey

The window doesn’t open and the fan is broke
And my face is turnin’ blue, yeah
I haven’t been in a crowd like this
Since I went to see The Who
Well, I should’ve got off a couple miles ago
But I couldn’t get to the door
There isn’t any room for me to breathe
And now we’re gonna pick up more, yeah

Another one rides the bus
Another one rides the bus
Another comes on, and another comes on
Another one rides the bus
Hey, he’s gonna sit by you
Another one rides the bus

Oh

Yeah
