Holy burning hand of wrath
Piercing forever through the heart

And this flaming orbit of shame
Ravages and splits the past

Grinding, binding, taking away
Needles above the prey
Wreath of barbs

Grinding, binding, taking away
Needles above the prey
Wreath of barbs

Wreath of barbs

The injection of religion
Has a comalike effect
And bodies lay in decay
Dreaming of a greener day

Grinding, binding, taking away
Needles above the prey
Wreath of barbs

Grinding, binding, taking away
Grinding, binding, taking away

Away

Open eyes, reading nothing
A sky harsh blue grins black
A sky harsh blue grins black
And I bleedm and bleed in this wreath of barbs
And I runm and run but I don’t get far, don’t get far, don’t get far

Grinding, binding, taking away
Needles above the prey
Wreath of barbs

Grinding, binding, taking away
Needles above the prey
Wreath of barbs

Wreath of barbs
Wreath of barbs

(Wreath of barbs)

Grinding, binding, taking away
Needles above the prey
Wreath of barbs

Grinding, binding, taking away
Needles above the prey
Wreath of barbs

Wreath of barbs
Wreath of barbs
Wreath of barbs
Wreath of barbs

Wreath of barbs
