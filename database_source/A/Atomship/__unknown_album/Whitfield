Whole, wide, world.

There's a man outside
and he's screaming that the elephants
are trampling,trampling, his father in his sleep.

There's a girl outside
and she's screaming that the worlds on fire
on fire today.

There's a man inside
and he's screaming for his noon time pills
at nine AM.

And there's a girl outside
who's screaming at the whole wide world
one hair at a time.

I'm trying so hard
to keep my eyes still
against the whole wide world
to make her love me.
Whitfield was my world today.

Love me.

Against the whole wide world, cause she won't love me.
Whitfield was my world.

There's a man inside
and he's screaming that his father
was never there.

There's a girl outside
and she's screaming at the whole wide world
one day at a time

There's a boy inside
and he's holding a picture
unto his head.

There's a girl outside
who's screaming that the worlds on fire
on fire today

I'm trying so hard to keep my eyes still
against the whole wide world.
To make her love me.
Whitfield was my world today.

Love me.
Against the whole wide world.
Cause she won't love me.
Whitfield was my world.
Whole wide world wide world wide world wide (x4)

Against the whole wide world.
To make her love me.
Whitfield was my world today.

Love me.
Against the whole wide world.
cause she won't love me.
Whitfield was my world.

The worlds on fire (x7)
The worlds on fire...today
