(Talking) Hey Yo, Mo B, Drop it on me.
Yeah, yeah let's do it like this

If I was your woman
And you were my man
You'd have no other woman
You'd be weak as a lamb.
If you had the strength.
To walk out my door.
My love would overrule my sense.
And I'd call you back for more.
If I was your woman
If I was your woman
And you were my man, yeahhh
She tears you down darling
Says you're nothing at all
But I'll pick you up darling
When she lets you fall
Cause, You're like a diamond
But she treats you like glass
Yet you beg her to love you
For me you won't ask

If I was your woman
If I was your woman
If I was your woman
Here's what I'd do
I'd never, never, no, no, stop lovin you.
Yeahhhhhhh, Yeah, mmm hmm


Life is so crazy
And love is unkind
Because she was first darling
Will she hang on your mind?
You're a part of me
But you don't even know it
I'm what you need
But I'm too afraid to show it

If I was your woman
If I was your woman
If I was your woman
Here's what I'd do
I'd never, never, no, no, stop lovin you

If I was your woman
Here's what I'd do
I'd never, never, never stop lovin you.
Uh,yeah, yeah,yea,yea,yea,yeah

If I was your woman (echo)
If I was your woman (echo)
If I was your woman (echo)
If I was your woman (echo)
If I was your woman (echo fades)
