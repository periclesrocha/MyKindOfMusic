I saw right through your eyes
I saw right through your guise
Every word that left you lips was
Just a covert disguise to hide your absent mind

You live and breathe, sleep and drink
Beg and plead, blind, diseased
No water can wash the blood off your hands

On Independence Day
On Independence Day

Traded the Nobel Peace Prize
Exchanged for Vietnamese lives
Bombs filled the Cambodian skies
In East Timor you stood up for the wrong side
Wrong side, wrong side

You live and breathe, sleep and drink
Beg and plead, blind, diseased
No water can wash the blood off your hands

On Independence Day
On Independence Day
On Independence Day
On Independence Day

No water can wash the blood off your hands
No it can't, no it can't
No water can wash the blood off your hands
No it can't, no it can't

No water can wash the blood off your hands
No it can't, no it can't
No water can wash the blood off your hands
No it can't, no it can't
