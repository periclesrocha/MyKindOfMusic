You should have ran for days
You embrace, you betray
I am sad to say, you're a sad cliche
But when you ran you tripped and fell
On a path that led you straight to hell!
This is the salt in your wounds
This is why I told you so

If you knew, what I know
Would you move, like you do
With malicious discontent you went about
hellbent to destroy but did you have a reason why?

Here's to lowering caskets of old friends,
Choice and consequence, we'll birth a new day
With the death of an old and start over, start over
Here's to burying hatchets in those who,
You never call your friends, we'll birth a new day
With the death of an old and start over, start over

Can you breathe in, reach in and let it out
The evil inside, that's eating you out, tonight!
With every venomous move,
I will suck you up and spit you out
Get out of my life, get out of my sight!

Here's to lowering caskets of old friends,
Choice and consequence, we'll birth a new day
With the death of an old and start over, start over
Here's to burying hatchets in those who,
You never call your friends, we'll birth a new day
With the death of an old and start over, start over

You let yourself get carried away
Don't act like you're ashamed
You let yourself get carried away
Bow your head now accept the blame
You let yourself get carried away
Bury this with you a waste

And now it's time to see, what you don't mean to me
Now it's time to see what you don't mean to me
Now it's time to see what you don't mean


Here's to lowering caskets of old friends,
Choice and consequence, we'll birth a new day
With the death of an old and start over, start over
Here's to burying hatchets in those who,
You never call your friends, we'll birth a new day
With the death of an old and....
