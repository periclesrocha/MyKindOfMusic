We sail across the sea,
In our thoughts we float over mountains
All this vanity that we could hide
The truth

The truth is to be alive
and to live your life in fear by hate
and create our own gods

We all ourselves are created
our own images
Ourselves we are created
our own gods

In the misty morning
When the sun is rising,
When the whole sky is red like blood
Man can realize the real meaning of life
to love and respect your life

Your salvation,
or is just your damnation.

We all ourselves...
