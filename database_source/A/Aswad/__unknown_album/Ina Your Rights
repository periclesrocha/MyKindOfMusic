Ina your rights can never be wrong
In every man heart, the truth must be strong
So in every day in every way, children
I know Jah won't forsake thee no
I know Jah won't forsake thee no
Children Jah won't forsake thee no
No Jah won't forsake thee oh no

Its often he who's first to criticize what he
Is seeing another man doing
He often hides the wrong he does in his wrong-doing
He's justifying, children
Speak the truth cos it what it will
Cos he who hide the wrong thing that he does
Do the wrong thing still
Wrong thing still he keeps on doing
His wrong-doing he's justifying
Oh Lord I know to some of them I say
The truth is an offence but never a sin
Ina your rights can never be wrong
In every man heart, the truth must be strong
So in every day, in every way, children
I know Jah won't forsake thee no
I know Jah won't forsake thee no
No Jah won't forsake thee if you do the right
No Jah he won't forsake thee no
But if the wrong thing still you keep on doing
Your wrong-doing you're justifying

Its often he who's first to laugh aloud
When he is seeing another man falling down
He often stays away
Never seeing what he could be doing
