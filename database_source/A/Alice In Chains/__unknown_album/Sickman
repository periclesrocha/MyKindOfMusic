What the hell am I?
Thousand eyes, a fly
Lucky then I'd be
In one day deceased

Sickman, sickman, sickman, sickman

I can feel the wheel, but I can't steer
When my thoughts become my biggest fear

Ah, what's the difference, I'll die
Ah, in this sick world of mine

What the hell am I?
Leper from inside
Inside wall of peace
Dirty and diseased

Sickman, sickman, sickman, sickman

I can see the end is getting near
I won't rest until my head is clear

Ah, what's the difference, I'll die
Ah, in this sick world of mine

(Yeah, though I walk through the valley of rape and despair
With head high and eyes alert, I tread on plane of many
We who are of good nature and intention, but cannot touch on the dark recesses of memory
And pain learned, so come walk with me
Feel the pain and release it)

Can you see the end?
Choke on me, my friend
Must to drown these thoughts
Purity over rot

What the hell am I?
Worn eroded pride
Saddened ten miles wide
I'm gonna let it slide

Sickman, sickman, sickman, sickman

I can feel the wheel but I can't steer
When my thoughts become my biggest fear

Ah, what's the difference, I'll die
Ah, in this sick world of mine

Ah
