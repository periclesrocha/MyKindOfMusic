Why can't I take it all okay?
I like to dig and fuck around with your day
I'm gonna tell your mamma
Yeh I'm gonna blackball your name
Ain't now way you'll go without me
Every chance I'll make you pay

On your space, in my face, I tell you I know
Somethin' 'bout you, I know somethin' 'bout you
In my space, on your face, I tell you I know somethin'
'Bout you, I know somethin'

Why can't I put your words away
I'd like to have more of you in my veins
I'm gonna tell your papa
Yeh I'm gonna try and ball your babe
Your gold key don't fit my crapper
Ain't got no shit today

On your space, in my face, I tell you I know
Somethin' 'bout you, I know somethin' 'bout you
In my space, on your face, I tell you I know somethin'
'Bout you, I know somethin'

I'm gonna tell your mama
Yeh I'm gonna blackball your name
Ain't no way you'll go without me
Every chance I'll make you pay

On your space, in my face, I tell you I know
Somethin' 'bout you, I know somethin' 'bout you
In my space, on your face, I tell you I know somethin'
'Bout you, I know somethin'
