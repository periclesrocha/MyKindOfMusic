Awww, put our heads together
Because a signature could change our future
Uh-huh
For some wrote you a letter
Begging you to reconsider
Yeah

Yeah (yeah-yea)

Put our heads together
Aaaaah-Aaah-Aaah
Fear the voices
You hear today
If you still have choices
We’ll blow you away

So they put number on the television Mr. Gardner
Oh yeah
A messed up generation put the pressure on you
You’re a coward
Uh-huh

Yeah (yea-hey)

A messed up generation
Aaaaah-Aaah-Aaah
Fear the voices
You hear today
If you still have choices
We’ll blow you away

We can see right through you, we’re awake
Send your men and we are all awake
Awake, awake, awake, awake
Wake, awake, awake, awake!

Fear the voices
You hear today
If you still have choices
We’ll blow you away

Fear the voices
Fear the voices
Fear the voices
Fear the voices
