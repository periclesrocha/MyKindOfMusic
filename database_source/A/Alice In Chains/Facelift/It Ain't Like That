Yea!

There I was, laid out on a table
Screamin’ sweat and bare feet to the floor

In my life, I’d not soften
Things that cut, and burn so often
But I sit, think of somethin’
Scared to face, the dyin’ nothin’

See the cycle I’ve waited for
Ain’t it like that anymore

Yea!

Where I go is when I feel I’m able
How I fight is why I’m feelin’ sore

In my mind not forgotten
Feel as though, a tooth were rotten
Behind the smile, a tongue that’s slippin’
Buzzards cry, when flesh is rippin’

See the cycle I’ve waited for
Ain’t it like that anymore

A-ah-ah-ah-ah

Yea!

Here I sit writing on the paper
Trying to make up words you can’t ignore

In my eyes, what I’m lacking
Score at face, a ten for slacking
Sign the deal, set in motion
Smaller fish, so huge the ocean

See the cycle I’ve waited for
Ain’t it like that anymore

See the cycle I’ve waited for
Ain’t it like that anymore
