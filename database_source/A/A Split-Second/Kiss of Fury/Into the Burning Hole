(Time after time, after time, after time, after time)
(Time after time, after time, after time, after time)
(Time after time, after time, after time, after time)
(Time after time, after time, after time, after time)

Petrified defender with a shotgun in his hands
You have to kill illusions when they no longer stand a chance
Pale blue faces in the snow
Where did all the feelings go?

Into the Burning Hole
Into the Burning Hole

To hate is such a simple act, why can’t we make it last
Losing all control again, it happened far too fast
Fill my heart with solitude and weeping acid rain
The feelings I have killed for you I’ll never feel again

Into the Burning Hole
Into the Burning Hole

(Time after time, after time, after time, after time)
(Time after time, after time, after time, after time)
(Time after time, after time, after time, after time)
(Time after time, after time, after time, after time)

(Into the Burning Hole)
(Into the Burning Hole)

Passion is a fire, it’s a fire that burns you out
But spinning in this tidal wave,
There is no room for doubt, so we go back

Into the Burning Hole
Into the Burning Hole
Into the Burning Hole
Into the Burning Hole

(Time after time, after time, after time, after time)
(Time after time, after time, after time, after time)
(Time after time, after time, after time, after time)
(Time after time, after time, after time, after time)

Into the Burning Hole
Into the Burning Hole
Into the Burning Hole
Into the Burning Hole
