A startling sense of dislocation
Pushed away by voodoo crap
Spill your poison somewhere else
Can’t shake the needles from your back

Guns and chains, emotional drains
Cutting it down to size
Captured by the hindu curse
that holds your mesmerized

Slice my throat, stiletto knife
to keep my burning hope alive
The long black hair that smells like incense
turns to vipers in my mind

You foul the pyramids with your presence
Holding in your tiny claws
The snakes that feed the witch with venom
Too late, no time to withdraw

Mambo witch
Mambo witch

Sound of torture and moral exhaustion
Barely concealed by telephone wires

Heal the wounds and lick the scars
Screw up your eyes to read your stars
She is fire, I am ice
Bound to burn at any price

I want to kill you…

Mambo witch
Mambo witch

I want to kill you…

Mambo witch
Mambo witch

Mambo witch
Mambo witch
