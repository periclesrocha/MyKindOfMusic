Down on my knees
I'm begging you
Down on my knees
I'm begging you
Down on my knees
I'm begging you
Please, please don't leave me

Do you really think she can love you more than me
Do you really, really think so
Do you really think she can give you more than me
Baby I know she won't

Cause I loved you unconditionally
I gave you even more than I had to give
I was willing for you to die
Cause you were more precious to me
Than my own life

Down on my knees
I'm begging you
Down on my knees
I'm begging you
Down on my knees
I'm begging you
Please, please don't leave me

I won't believe
That you really, really wanna leave me
Just because of her
Have you forgot about
All the things we've been through
She was not the one
Who was there for you

I loved you unconditionally
I gave you even more than I had to give
I was willing for you to die
Cause you were more precious to me
Than my own life

Down on my knees
I'm begging you
Down on my knees
I'm begging you
Down on my knees
I'm begging you
Please, please don't leave me

Don't leave me
I'm begging
I love you
I need you
I'm dying
I'm crying
I'm begging
Please love me

I love you
I love you
I'm begging
Please love me
I'm dying
I'm crying
Please don't leave me
No, no, no, no, no

Down on my knees
I'm begging you
Down on my knees
I'm begging you
Down on my knees, down on my knees
I'm begging you, you, you, you, you

Down on my knees
Down on my knees
Down on my knees
I'm begging youu

Down on my knees
Down on my knees
Down on my knees
I'm begging youu
