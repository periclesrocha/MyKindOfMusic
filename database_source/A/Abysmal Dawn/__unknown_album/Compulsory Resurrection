His DNA was reconstructed
The laws of nature which once obstructed
A mortal man to rise again
Have been rewritten to cleanse our sins

Hope in turn has made them blind
Cannot perceive the harsh realities that be
Their savior has risen
To bring about the Christian holocaust

You must believe for this is a sign
Far beyond a dream he rises from torment divine

God is in me but now that I can see
They're putting out my eyes

Compulsory resurrection
Will bring an end to their infection
For how much longer can they defend
An artificial savior which bleeds like men

You must believe for this is a sign
Far beyond a dream he rises from torment divine

God is in me but now that I can see
They're putting out my eyes

Worlds they change yet reinstate
Their sordid martyrs up upon a cross
