You got your hands in my pockets
You're whisperin' lies in my ear
Such promiscuous intentions
Don't mistake me for someone who cares
There were times I fooled myself, yeah
Thinkin' I was someone else
Hard days, cold nights
Nothin' that I could do, yeah
Love is like babes in arms (babes in arms)
Yes, it's true, that's right, true, yes, it's true, ooh

Such a restless condition
The way you're turnin' it on
Love 'em, tease 'em, for all the wrong reasons
You know you're such a bore

There were times I told myself (myself)
There was really no-one else
Hard days, cold nights
Nothin' that I can do, ooh


Love is like babes in arms (babes in arms)
Yes, it's true, it's true baby, true, yes, it's true, look out

Is it some kind of shakedown?
You know I really don't care
But, you push it too hard, girl
Yeah, you know it's just not fair

There were times I fooled myself
Thinkin' there was no-one else
Hard days, cold nights
There's nothin' that I could do, ooh
Love is like babes in arms (babes in arms)
Yes, it's true, true, come on, come on, come on
Hard days, cold nights
Nothin' that I can do
Love is like babes in arms (babes in arms)
Yes, it's true, yes yes, it's true
Hard days, cold nights
Oh, there's nothin' that I could do, yeah
Love is like babes in arms (babes in arms)
Yes, it's true, yes it's true, you, you you
Hard days, cold nights
