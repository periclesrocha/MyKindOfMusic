Drive by my house late at night
You can see from the freeway above
No silhouette but a light left on
Burning there for love
Burning there for love

Smoke is rising from the back
Coming out of my back door
I’m inside, sound asleep
Cigarette on the floor

Burning there for love
Burning there for love

Well, I can still remember
A couple of years ago
When the smoke and flame from our name
Was a burning house of love
Yea, a burning house of love
A burning house of love

Burning house of love
Burning house of love

Oh, I can still remember
A couple of years ago
When the smoke and flame from our name
Was a burning house of love
Yea, a burning house of love
A burning house of love

That rusty nail over our front door
Is where I hung our tears on a ring
I threw that horseshoe into the weeds
To see what luck can bring
To see what luck can bring

Now you’re in your bed and I’m in mine
On either side of town
I think I might take a ride
And burn your love house down

Like a burning house of love
Burning house of love

I can still remember
A couple of years ago
When the smoke and flame from our name
Was a burning house of love
Yea, a burning house of love
A burning house of love

Burning house of love
Burning house of love
Burning house of love
Burning house of…

Love
