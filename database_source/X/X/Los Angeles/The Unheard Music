Friends, warehouse, pain
Attack their own kind

A thousand kids bury their parents

There’s laughing outside
We’re locked out of the public eye

Some smooth chords on the car radio
No hard chords on the car radio

We set the trash on fire
And watch outside the door
Men come up the pavement under the marquee

There’s laughing inside
We’re locked out of the public eye

Some smooth chords on the car radio
No hard chords on the car radio

Friends, warehouse, pain
Attack their own kind

A thousand kids bury their parents

There’s laughing outside
We’re locked out of the public eye

Some smooth chords on the car radio
No hard chords on the car radio

Some smooth chords on the car radio
No hard chords on the car radio
