Wicked seeds of desperation
Who'd ever dream that this memory would come back
Evil deeds that breed temptation
I close my eyes but I cannot relax

I can't assume to know his reasons
I can't attempt to put a name upon his face
Empty eyes I see the demon
If I could I would leave this place

Part of me doesn't even care
Part of me wasn't even there

Another wave to crash around me
A pulling current that could bring me to my knees
Where was I during the beating
Separation of body mind and...

Part of me doesn't even care
Part of me wasn't even there

I can still see his face
The lines upon his face
And if could erase the hate
That breeds this nightmare
And how was I to know
A child of twelve years old
A hollow seed
But I can be
Whatever I
Want to be

Part of me doesn't even care
Part of me wasn't even there
Part of me doesn't even care
Part of me wasn't even there
