I'm a teenage Jesus superstar without a mighty cross to bear,
And when mom complains about my hair,
I say hey mom I just don't care.

I'm in hell and the angels cry cause I'm trying to sell my soul,
And when mom complains about my clothes,
I say hey mom leave me alone.

Come on little girl, it's gonna be alright,
Come on little girl, it's gonna be alright,
I got one thing on my mind girl,
I got one thing on my mind and I don't care. x2

I'm a teenage Jesus superstar without a mighty cross to bear,
And when mom complains about my hair,
I say hey mom I just don't care.

I'm in hell and the angels cry cause I'm trying to sell my soul,
And when mom complains about my clothes,
I say hey mom leave me alone.
