No raving beauty
But she's got a good heart
He's got escaping
Down to an art

This ain't pleasure
Don't ask why
This ain't pleasure
And monkeys can't fly

She's an infection,
A stain on his soul
He's her addiction
They're out of control

This ain't pleasure
Don't ask why
This ain't pleasure
And monkeys can't fly, oh no

This ain't pleasure
Don't ask why
This ain't pleasure
And monkeys can't fly
