<A scrub is a guy that thinks he's fly, and is
Also known as a buster.
Always talkin' about what he wants and just
Sits on his broke
So(no)
I don't want your number (no)
I don't want to give you mine (no)
I don't want to meet you nowhere (no)
I don't want none of your time and (no)
I don't want no scrub.
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me.
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Tryin' to holler at me!
I don't want no scrub.
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me.
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Tryin' to holler at me!
There's a scrub checkin' me. but his game is kinda weak.
And i know that he cannot approach me.
'Cause I'm lookin' like cla*s and he's
Lookin' like trash.
Can't get wit' no deadbeat.

If you don't have a car and your walkin'
Oh yes son I'm talkin' to you
If you live at home wit' your momma
Oh yes son I'm talkin' to you (baby)
If you have a shorty and you don't show love
Oh yes son I'm talkin' to you
Wanna get with me with no money,
Oh no! I don't know (oh)
