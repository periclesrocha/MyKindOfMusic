You're drawn to a new love
You are mesmerized
Memories swell
And circle in your mind
You long you fantasize
You're hypnotized

I haunt you

Like wine and licorice
I haunt you I haunt you
I taste you on my lips
I haunt you I haunt you

You're lured to a new love
You are magnetized
Images torment
Repeating in your mind
You need you feel alive
You're mystified

Haunting
It's what you feel
Haunting

Like wine and licorice
I haunt you I haunt you
I taste you on my lips
I haunt you I haunt you

From the mist she calls, she calls, she calls
Come to me

You drown in a new love
You are petrified
Reality torments
Twisting in your mind
Fear you feel deprived
You're sacrificed

Like wine and licorice
I haunt you I haunt you
I taste you on my lips
I haunt you I haunt you
