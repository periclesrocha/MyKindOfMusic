I remember nigga
Boosie Bad Azz
I remember nigga
I remember nigga

Now I remember everythin' from them cold night on the block
I remember the struggle, I remember the shine
I remember they faces when they saw me shine
Nigga I remember everythin', I remember nigga

Outside with no shirt, I remember nigga
Talked loud in that church, I remember nigga
Nigga stole all my work, I remember nigga
Kirby took my lick in court, I remember nigga

Them plantation days, do you remember that?
The good times that we had in big digem lac
Do you remember Debra Proch when it was hot and steamin'?
Do you remember when we moved shop down there by leman?

Do you remember at the room hoes caughtin' semen?
Do you remember I busted two with the green eye demon?
Yeah, nigga I remember cross the tracks
When Capt. Ricks and Kenny Wayne had a gang of that crack

Man, I remember all that when E-40 was jammin'
Everybody play B's and D's listenin' to that Dayton family
I remember Daddy-O when he put me on syrup
Remember Junior was fourteen workin' with a quarter bird nigga

Them long nights on the block, I remember nigga
Went from a little to a lot, I remember nigga
And in this world with no dreams, I remember nigga
Gone off X and codeine, I remember nigga

Them long nights on the block, I remember nigga
Went from a little to a lot, I remember nigga
And in this world with no dreams, I remember nigga
Gone off X and codeine, I remember nigga

When daddy left this world, I remember nigga
That nights I made them lil' girls, I remember nigga
Grandpa preachin' at church, I remember nigga
Grucen gave me my first work, I remember nigga

Me and Big Chris on the block, I remember nigga
Walk in the school with a knot, I remember nigga
Remember nobody ain't like us, I remember nigga
When I set it off with Titus, I remember nigga

Seventeen I was a donkey, killin' my own people
[ Lil' Boosie Lyrics are found on www.songlyrics.com ]
Servin' my own uncles, gave life to Ttrell, I remember nigga
When he touch down I caused hell, I remember nigga
My first fifty block of weed, I remember nigga

I remember nineteen, I remember nigga
When I first meet Tee and Mel, I remember nigga
When y'all got me out of jail, I remember nigga
Yeah, I remember nigga

Them long nights on the block, I remember nigga
Went from a little to a lot, I remember nigga
And in this world with no dreams, I remember nigga
Gone off X and codeine, I remember nigga

Them long nights on the block, I remember nigga
Went from a little to a lot, I remember nigga
And in this world with no dreams, I remember nigga
Gone off X and codeine, I remember nigga

First time I rode clean, I remember nigga
Got my heart broke at fourteen, I remember nigga
Remember the first nigga I robbed, I remember
I remember them tears cried, I remember they killed I

I remember them pills I used to pop that had a nigga frenzy
Same niggas I used to pop with now they envy
Cousins frenzy I'm on some flossed out shit
I go to Emmy when I wanna floss my wrist

Remember daddy used to hit momma when times was hard
But it never showed on her boys 'cause her boys was spoiled, nigga
Remember my beamer, my magnum and my forty five
Remember my silver STS with the fresh ties

My old school Monte Carlo nigga, candy black
Remember my Ram Truck, my old school Cadillac
Remember my Benz that was black but I wet it silver
Remember my orange and black race car with them, dance nigga

I remember everythin', I remember
I remember nigga
I remember everythin', I remember
I remember nigga

I remember everythin', I remember
I remember nigga
I remember everythin', I remember
I remember nigga
Like it was yesterday
