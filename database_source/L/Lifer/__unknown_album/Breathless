offended by my obscenity
mouth full of soap
cleansing me
asking for a little empathy
mouth is stained please let me
breathe
don't breathe, don't breathe
i can't breathe
breathe
don't breathe, don't breathe
i can't breathe
i am suffocating
i am suffocating
i am suffocating
i am so frustrated
drowning in my insecurity
i am on my hands and knees
begging for a little symapthy
begging you to help me
breathe
don't breathe, don't breathe
i can't breathe
breathe
don't breathe, don't breathe
i can't breathe
i am suffocating
i am suffocating
i am suffocating
i am so frustrated
