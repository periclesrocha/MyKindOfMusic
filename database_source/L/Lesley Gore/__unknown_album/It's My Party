It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to
Cry if I want to
You would cry too, if it happened to you

Nobody knows where my Johnny has gone
But Judy left the same time
Why was he holding her hand
When he's supposed to be mine?

It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to
Cry if I want to
You would cry too, if it happened to you

Play all my records, keep dancing all night
But leave me alone for awhile
Till Johnny's dancing with me
I've got no reason to smile

It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to
Cry if I want to
You would cry too, if it happened to you

Judy and Johnny just walked through the door
Like a queen with her king
Oh, what a birthday surprise
Judy's wearing his ring

It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to
Cry if I want to
You would cry too, if it happened to you

Oh, it's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to
Cry if I want to
You would cry too, if it happened to you

Oh, it's my party and I'll cry if I want to
