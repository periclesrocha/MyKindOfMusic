Well I'm going down, Going down a hard road
Just don't know, don't know where I've been
But I think I've been walking, I'm walking round in circles
Can't even find a friend
Woah, my love, my love she's not waiting
Think I might've been gone, I've been gone too long
People make me crazy
I can hardly sing my song
Hustlers stand around me,
I'm lost and all alone
Can't tell the bad from the good
I'm lost ins the woods, I'm lost in the woods
Big city gamblers, gamblers take my money
Yes it gets to be useless, yes it's useless to me
And I think I'm lost, when I'm lost inside this jungle
Can't see the forest for the tress
Well pretty little woman come and get me
Try me, try me one more time
Yes and your sweet, your sweet understanding
Cant' fix this broken heart of mine
The vultures fly around, come and take me home
Can't tell the bad from the good
I'm out in the woods, I'm lost in the woods
I'm a man gone crazy in the woods
I'm wandering around the bush
