I’m dancing with my demons
I’m hanging off the edge
Storm clouds gather beneath me
Waves break above my head

At first hallucination
I wanna fall wide awake now
You tell me it’s alright
Tell me I’m forgiven
Tonight
But nobody can save me now
I’m holding up a light
Chasing up the darkness inside
’Cause nobody can save me

Stare into this illusion
For answers yet to come
I chose a false solution
But nobody proved me wrong

At first hallucination
I wanna fall wide awake
Watch the ground giving way now
You tell me it’s alright
Tell me I’m forgiven
Tonight
But nobody can save me now
I’m holding up a light
I’m chasing up the darkness inside
’Cause nobody can save me

Been searching somewhere out there
For what’s been missing right here
I’ve been searching somewhere out there
For what’s been missing right here

I wanna fall wide awake now
So tell me it’s alright
Tell me I’m forgiven
Tonight
If only I can save me now
I’m holding up a light
Chasing up the darkness inside
And I don’t wanna let you down
But only I can save me
Been searching somewhere out there
For what’s been missing right here
