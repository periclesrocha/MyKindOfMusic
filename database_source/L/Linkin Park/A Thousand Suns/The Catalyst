God bless us everyone
We’re a broken people living under loaded gun
And it can’t be outfought
It can’t be outdone
It can’t be outmatched
It can’t be outrun, no

God bless us everyone
We’re a broken people living under loaded gun
And it can’t be outfought
It can’t be outdone
It can’t be outmatched
It can’t be outrun, no

And when I close my eyes tonight
To symphonies of blinding light
God bless us everyone
We’re a broken people living under loaded gun

Oh, like memories in cold decay
Transmissions echoing away
Far from the world of you and I
Where oceans bleed into the sky

God save us everyone
Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns
For the sins of our hand
The sins of our tongue
The sins of our father
The sins of our young, no
God save us everyone
Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns
For the sins of our hand
The sins of our tongue
The sins of our father
The sins of our young, no

And when I close my eyes tonight
Two symphonies of blinding light
God save us everyone
Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns

Oh, like memories in cold decay
Transmissions echoing away
Far from the world of you and I
Where oceans bleed into the sky

Oh, like memories in cold decay
Transmissions echoing away
Far from the world of you and I
Where oceans bleed into the sky

Lift me up, let me go
Lift me up, let me go
Lift me up, let me go
Lift me up, let me go
Lift me up, let me go
Lift me up, let me go
Lift me up, let me go
Lift me up, let me go

It can’t be outfought
It can’t be outdone
It can’t be outmatched
It can’t be outrun, no

God bless us everyone
We’re a broken people living under loaded gun
And it can’t be outfought
It can’t be outdone
It can’t be outmatched
It can’t be outrun, no

God bless us everyone (Lift me up)
We’re a broken people living under loaded gun (Let me go)
And it can’t be outfought (Lift me up)
It can’t be outdone
It can’t be outmatched (Let me go)
It can’t be outrun
