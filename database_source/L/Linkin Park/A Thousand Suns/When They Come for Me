Yeah
I am not a pattern to be followed
The pill that I’m on is a tough one to swallow
I’m not a criminal, not a role model
Not a born leader, I’m a tough act to follow
I am not the fortune and the fame
Nor the same person telling you to forfeit the game
I came in the ring like a dog on a chain
And I found out the underbelly’s sicker than it seems
And it seems ugly, but it can get worse
’Cause even a blueprint is a gift and a curse
’Cause once you got a theory of how the thing works
Everybody wants the next thing to be just like the first
And I’m not a robot, I’m not a monkey
I will not dance, even if the beat’s funky
Opposite of lazy, far from a punk
You all ought to stop talking
Start trying to catch up, motherfucker

And all the people say
Aah-aah-aah
Tryin’ to catch up mother fucker
Aah-aah-aah

Lauryn said money change a situation
Big said it increase the complication
Kane said "Don’t step. I ain’t the one."
Chuck said that Uzi weigh a motherfucking ton
And I’m just a student of the game that they taught me
Rocking every stage in every place that it brought me
I’m awfully underrated, but came here to correct it
And so it ain’t mistaken, I’mma state it for the record
I am
The opposite of wack
Opposite of weak
Opposite of slack
Synonym of heat
Synonym of crack
Closest to a peak
Far from a punk
You all ought to stop talking
Start trying to catch up, motherfucker

And all the people say
Aah-aah-aah
Trying to catch up mother fucker
Aah-aah-aah

Oh when they come for me
Come for me
I’ll be gone
Oh when they come for me
Come for me
I’ll be gone
Oh when they come for me
Come for me
I’ll be gone

And all the people say
Aah-aah-aah
Trying to catch up mother fucker
Aah-aah-aah
And all the people say
Aah-aah-aah
Trying to catch up mother fucker

Escuchénme, preste atención
Escuchénme ahora
Escuchénme ahora
Escuchénme todos
Escuchénme ahora mismo

Aah-aah-aah
Aah-aah-aah
Aah-aah-aah
