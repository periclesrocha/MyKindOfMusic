God save us everyone
Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns
For the sins of our hands, sins of our tongue
Sins of our father, the sins of our young
God save us everyone
Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns
For the sins of our hands, sins of our tongue
Sins of our father, the sins of our young
