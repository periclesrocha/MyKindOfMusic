Yeh Yeh Yeh
I done learned from mistakes like who's my man
N' Who's not, like who's gon run and who's not
Like who's gon shoot if you shot
Who gon hold they own, who's not
Who gon change glocks

[Chorus x2]

In the street of new york you can't trust nobody
Niggas'll run up on you with a 12 gauge shoty
Loyalty comes free and smokin' weed is my hobby
You wanna rob me you gotta leave here with a body

[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]

When I was 10 years old I seen a nigga take 3 in the head
Probably around the same time you use to pee in the bed
I'd stay awake cause my nightmares was seein' him dead
The smell of burnt tires peelin after leavin him lead
The killer fled with a fuckin laugh
My heart pumpin on blast
I just stare at him slumped in the grass
Arms movin, fingers shakin, spittin up blood
DNA mixed in the mud, another ditch to be dug
Their I stood stiffer than wood it's the homie that use to buy me candy
Now he's gone who's gonna provide his family
My air bring this shit up n' runnin I never thought I'd be that sick
Damn I wasn't suppose to see that shit
That's when I thought, it was more than 3 shots
It could have been the aimin for me, maybe he circled around the block
I turned around and my pops, he like 'what happened?'
This nigga rolled up and just started clappin', I can still hear him laughin'

[Chorus x2]
In the street of new york you can't trust nobody
Niggas'll run up on you with a 12 gauge shoty
Loyalty comes free and smokin' weed is my hobby
You wanna rob me you gotta leave here with a body

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]

It was a regular day in southside, sprinklers n' kids runnin'
And all of a sudden heads turnin', somebody did sumthin
This nigga named, I forgot, fuck it he lived around the block
Regular getting' money nigga but loved to clown a lot
Walk across the park stuntin' and frontin'
Diamonds in his ears, diamond watch on, eatin a bag of popcorn
Walked up behind a shorty and grabbin' her waist
She pushed him away
So he threw the bag in her face
She felt disrespected , shorty couldn't accept it
Called him a pussy told him she'd be back in a second
But he ain't payin no mind called her a bitch about 4 times
Stayed in the park, with no niggas with him and no nine
And then in no time an older nigga from behind
Swung a baseball bat
Left his face all crack
Told him to take all that
Hit him again popped his chain with a frown
And left the clown with a stain on the ground

[Chorus x2]
In the street of new york you can't trust nobody
Niggas'll run up on you with a 12 gauge shoty
Loyalty comes free and smokin' weed is my hobby
You wanna rob me you gotta leave here with a body

[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]

Now all my days go by blowin that sicky icky
California made me picky
Chickenheads tryin' to stick me with a hicky
If we, roll up quickly, stick me, some was tipsy
The location don't matter I'm southside until they hit me
I'd be dead
If looks can kill, I'm from the ghetto boys
But I don't know scarface or Bushwick Bill, My heart spills
For the kids who ain't got nothing and who got to steal, and from my
Cousin I lost, lookd over the steerin wheel

[Chorus x2]
In the street of new york you can't trust nobody
Niggas'll run up on you with a 12 gauge shoty
Loyalty comes free and smokin' weed is my hobby
You wanna rob me you gotta leave here with a body
