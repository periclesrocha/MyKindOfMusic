Delicate is your heart
If you move, it may stop
You run around unaware
How delicate each beat
Trembles in my ear
Men will be boys
With fire and toys
And football

And I will always be aware
Of how delicate each beat
trembles in my ear
Paper thin is how we begin
And we move from there

I can hold your heart in my hand
Feel each beat's demand
Your paper skin
And the universe that echoes within

And I will always be aware
Of how delicate each beat
trembles in my ear
Paper thin is how we begin
And we move from there

So stay warm
And safe from harm
In my garden is where you belong

Paper skin is how we begin
And we move from there
Paper thin is how we begin
And move from there

Paper thin is my heart
If you move, it may stop
You run around unaware
Of how delicate each beat
Trembles in here...
