Let's just get married
Raise our own family
Everyone's so unhappy
They follow a heart that's asked from the start
To bleed

I cannot wait for
I will not wait forever
It's such a drag
Nobody knows me better
I'm heavy like Sunday
I wanna be your reason why
I'm heavy like Sunday
I wanna be your reason why

Let's leave those dark days behind
Mistakes are made
But our decisions change our design
The damage is nearly said and done
So let's take the money, yeah
Take the money and run

I cannot wait for
I will not wait forever
It's such a drag
Nobody knows me better
I'm heavy like Sunday
I wanna be your reason why
I'm heavy like Sunday
I wanna be your alibi

And friends make better lovers
'Cause they look you in the eye
And they'll put you in the middle
Of a thousand whys
