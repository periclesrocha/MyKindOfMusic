And I still love him tonight
no distance or time can bite
and i still feel out of place
in crowded rooms
and the silence of space

no love could be
this hard to beat
i still read your star signs
star signs

and they know just when to hit
when morning comes and your friends
they gotta split
and you know just what to say
when no one's around you know how to play

no love could be this hard
to beat
i still read your star signs, star signs

baby, baby can't you see
this world ain't big enough for you or me so
light the candles and turn out your lights
and turn on my lights

no love could be this hard to beat
i still read your star signs, star signs
i don't even know what they mean
what you mean

I don't even know what you mean
what you mean
