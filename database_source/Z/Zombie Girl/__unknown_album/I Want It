I, I have this need
I need to see you bleed
I need to taste your brain
Oh god it drives me insane

Come, come over here my dear
Theres nothing for you to fear
I need a little piece of your head
So you too can be among the living dead

You know I need it
You know I feel it
You know I want it
Some fresh blood and flesh

Please forgive for me wrong
My desire is umm so strong
I can not help it I have to obey
You know i'll eat you if you choose to stay

Cause i'm an angel
Cause I'm am a devil
Cause I am a lost soul
Feeding off your flesh and blood

You are my angel
You are my lost soul
You are the one I need to kill my desire to feed

You know I need it
You know I feel it
You know I want it
Some fresh blood and flesh

(2x)
Cause I'm a girl
I am a zombie
I am a girl
I am a zombie
I am a girl
I am a zombie
I am a girl
I am a zombie girl

You know I need it
You know I feel it
You know I want it
Some fresh blood and flesh
