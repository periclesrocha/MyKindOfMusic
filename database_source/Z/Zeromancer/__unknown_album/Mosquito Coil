It's looking out
From inside
A Christmas bonus
To last forever
You think you're ready, dont you

Its a mosquito coil
Where boys and girls
Trying to stop
Their heads spinning
A mosquito coil
An instant supernova
For beginners

Once you're in
You can't get out
Dashboard Jesus
Has your number
And please remember me
In your circle of friends

What's killing you
Is killing me
One fling leads to another
