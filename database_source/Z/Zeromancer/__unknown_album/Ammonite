It's hidden well deep inside
You don't want me to tell you why
What means nothing to you
means everything to me

Assimilating tears to the floor
I don't know you anymore
Assimilating to the floor
I don't know you anymore

Come on crawl out of my head
Ammonite
What means nothing to you
means everything to me

Means everything to me

Assimilating tears to the floor
I don't know you anymore
Assimilating tears to the floor
I don't know you anymore

That was then this is now
Got to get through somehow
That was then this is now
Got to get through somehow
Yeah got to get through somehow

Om du kunne se alt jeg kan se
I ensom majestet
Jeg lever i en synd
Svever på en løgn
Uten deg har jeg ingenting
