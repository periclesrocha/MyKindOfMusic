Now that I know
the feel of your touch:
ameliorating.

Reeling under
the surge of your ocean,
I can’t resist it.

This is going to hurt,
this is going to make you feel alive
like nothing else could.

Now that I know
the scent of your skin:
intoxicating.

Right here in the dark,
in a surge of emotion,
I can’t be sated.

This is going to hurt,
this is going to make you feel alive
like nothing else could.

Like nothing else could.

So here we are…
exactly where I feared we’d be
if we were left alone for too long.

And the wave’s coming crashing down,
and the wave’s coming crashing down,
so hold me close, surrender to the fall,
to the foam,
to the warmth of it all.

So hold me close, surrender to the fall
to the foam
to the warmth of it all.

This is going to hurt,
this is going to make you feel alive
like nothing else could.

Like nothing else could.
Like nothing else could.
