To have no self, to be reborn:
cast me in gold, put me in the ground.

To face this truth, to become undone:
break me with stone, put me in the ground.

Where do you go when you’ve seen it all?
What’s left to learn when you’ve touched the void?

We are alone, we are the last of us.
We are alone, we are the last of us.
We are alone, we are the last of us.
We are alone, we are the last of us.

We are alone.
We are alone.

We are the last of us.
We are the last of us.

We are alone, we are the last of us.
