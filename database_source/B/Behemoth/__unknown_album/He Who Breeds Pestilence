Inflict the seed of Eden upon me
The heritage of Cain can't be undone
'Tis my rejection! 'Tis my denial!
That stirs with repulsive mortifications
They attempt to deprive me
From my odium of chaos
They threw my wretched body
Into rivers of purgatory
For such is consequence
Of my angelic nature
Abortion of god in my leprous womb

Soiled with the miasma of the bleakest hemisphere
The formless fires of Amenti unfold
Not nearly as frenzied as discordia that breeds within
Not nearly as frenzied as disorder that I bring
Universe is drained
So is my heart
This earth grew weary and dull
Is it the renaissance of my rigid existence?
Is there a future for me beyond the stars?

I drink to desolation
I drink to your demise
Monarch of neglected kingdom
Oh great despiser of life

Et credo in serpentem
Misterium mysteriorum
In nomen eius Baphomet

Hearken! My Ophities
Consume the flesh and drink the blood
Obtain communion with utmost disgrace
Reject the benefits of eucharist
Disdain the lie!
Let your senses sharpen
Let your eyes see in the boundless dark
Resist not radiant light
Be like comets slashing through the vast skies
Be like ravening wolves
Unchaining hearts

Now drink to desolation
Drink to god's demise
Monarch of neglected kingdom
Oh great despiser of life

O leo et o serpens
Qui perditor perdes
Sis valens nobiscum
