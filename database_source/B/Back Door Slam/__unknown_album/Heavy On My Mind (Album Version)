Late at night, end of the road
Headlights under headstones
Maybe my mind is playing tricks on me

Mouth is dry, heart skips a beat
Ground spinning underneath my feet
Maybe my mind is playing tricks on me

Every creak of the door, every foot step I hear
Every hollow of the wind, makes me tremble with fear, with fear

Another sleepless night, oh woh it's heavy my mind
Lord I can't escape, my conscienss thought I left it way behind
Oh woh, it's heavy on my mind

Try to sleep, but I swear I saw
Something moving down the corridor
Maybe my mind is playing tricks on me

Wake up in a cold sweat, this nightmare ain't over yet
Maybe my mind is playing tricks on me
Every portrait in every room
Seems to follow my every move

Another sleepless night, oh woh heavy my mind
Lord I can't escape, my conscienss thought I left it way behind
Oh woh, it's heavy on my mind

Every creak of the door, every foot step I hear
Oh no no. Every hollow of the wind, makes me tremble with fear, with fear

Another sleepless night, oh woh it's heavy my mind
Lord I can't escape, my conscienss the thought I left it way behind
Oh woh, it's heavy on my mind

Heavy on my mind
