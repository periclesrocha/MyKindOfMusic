Someday we will grow tired of these shells
And someday we will lay ourselves to rest
I take you into me
Breathing in you deeply

Some days

Some days, I can feel you burning through my veins
I look to the light
I can feel my eyes burn
Looking down, the ground beneath is falling fast
Shedding the cares of this world

I'm sick
God knows I'm sick of making
Now I'm so sick of making excuses for myself

Now all the saints are dancing with the demons tonight
Welcome me home

I'm home
I'm home
I'm home
