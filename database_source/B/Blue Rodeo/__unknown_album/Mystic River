I can't believe it's true I finally got you here
I been waiting for this moment for some years
I've been torn down enough to know
Everyone goes through this door
Just before their lives explode
Come in here with a heavy load

Walking down the road watching the day begin
Radio song is playing off in a distant wind
But you can feel it its a gentle love
Coming out soft from the windows above
Just when you have had enough
Here comes the world you've been dreaming of

Oh my my the Mystic River
She takes your heart
And you will forgive her
Lay me down beside the water
I look across at the sons and daughters

Sun comes up each day to chase away the moon
Even the stars at night they fade away too soon
You can't do much about the trouble life brings
Cut all the lines so the phones don't ring
But stay here once from spring to spring
Watching the ice melt the mornings sing

Oh my my the Mystic River
She takes your heart
And you will forgive her
Lay me down beside the water
I miss my sons I miss my daughter now

There's a tree that grows out in the burning sands
Never a drop of rain that nobody understands
You can push me I don't mind
Leave me out here and I'll be fine
Cause everyone's gonna have their time
Up or down honey you decide

Oh my my the Mystic River
She takes your heart
And you will forgive her
Lay me down beside the water
I miss my sons I miss my daughter now
