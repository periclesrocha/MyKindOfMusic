I'm out of this world
and I'm never comin' back
Ever since that day by the side of the road
I got a smile on my face and I'm
never coming to
never coming to
never coming to

I'm leaving today and I'm never coming back
Killed by a girl by the side of the road

I'm out cold and I'm never coming to
I'm out cold and I'm never coming..

I love I love I love I love I love I love
I never love I never love I never never never never
what I mean to say
What I tried to say
is that I never never got my way

I'm out of this world
and I'm never comin' back
Ever since that day by the side of the road
I got a smile on my face and I'm
never coming to
never coming to
never coming to

I'm out of this world
and I'm never comin' back
Ever since that day by the side of the road
I got a smile on my face and I'm
never coming to
never coming to
never coming to

Lucifer got a hold of me
said gonna set you free

I'm out cold and I'm never coming to
I'm out cold and I'm never coming..

Now I'm lookin' for the sun
lookin' for the sun
hope the dried in the sun lookin' for the sun
Someone took me for a joyride
Led me straight into a ditch

I'm out of this world
and I'm never comin' back
Ever since that day by the side of the road
I got a smile on my face and I'm
never coming to
never coming to
never coming to

double time working machine
I had a big bad plan it was a real cool dream
I'm out cold and I'm never coming to
I'm out cold and I'm never coming..

suckin' on a little red rock
by the side of the road
up in a puddle of blood
save my soul

I'm out cold and I'm never coming to
I'm out cold and I'm never coming..
I'm out cold and I'm never coming to
I'm out cold and I'm never coming to
