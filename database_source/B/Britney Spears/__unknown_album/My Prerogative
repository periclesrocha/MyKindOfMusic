People can take everything away from you
But they can never take away your truth
But the question is
Can you handle mine?

They say I'm crazy
I really don't care
That's my prerogative

They say I'm nasty
But I don't give a damn
Getting boys is how I live

Some ask me questions
Why am I so real?
But they don't understand me

I really don't know the truth about my sister
Trying hard to make it right
Not long ago before I won this fight

Everybody's talkin' all this stuff about me
Why don't they just let me live? (Tell me why)
I don't need permission, make my own decisions (Oh!)
That's my prerogative

That's my prerogative

(It's my prerogative)

It's the way that I wanna live
(It's my prerogative)
You can't tell me what to do

Don't get me wrong
I'm really not souped
Ego trips is not my thing

All these strange relationships
Really gets me down
I see nothing wrong spreading myself around

Everybody's talkin' all this stuff about me
Why don't they just let me live? (Tell me why)
I don't need permission, make my own decisions (Oh!)
That's my prerogative

That's my prerogative

Everybody's talkin' all this stuff about me
Why don't they just let me live? (Tell me why)
I don't need permission, make my own decisions (Oh!)
That's my prerogative

That's my prerogative

Its the way that I wanna live

(It's my prerogative)

They can't tell me what to do

Why can't I live my life?
Without all of the things that people say?

Ohoho
(Oh!)

Everybody's talkin' all this stuff about me
Why don't they just let me live? (Tell me why)
I don't need permission, make my own decisions (Oh)
That's my prerogative

(They say I'm crazy) Everybody's talkin' all this stuff about me
Why don't they just let me live? (Tell me why)
(They say I'm nasty) I don't need permission, make my own decisions (Oh!)
(Ah!)That's my prerogative

(That's my prerogative)
