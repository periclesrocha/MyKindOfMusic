Feeling now, feeling down
This feeling wouldn't leave me alone
Then I came, the one that said
Hey Dread, fly Natty Dread

And smile (In Jamaica)
Want you to smile (In Jamaica)
Get it to together right now (In Jamaica)
Get things together right now (In Jamaica)

Soulful town, roots people
Said I see that you're having fun
Rockin' to the roots man rocker
Oh island in the sun

Oh Oh (In Jamaica)
Want you get it together (In Jamaica)
Get this together right now (In Jamaica)
Get this together right now (In Jamaica)

Help the children, help them right
Oh lord help them decide
Cast away that evil spell
Throw some water in the well

Well well well well (In Jamaica)
C'mon and smile (In Jamaica)
Get things together right now (In Jamaica)
Get it together right now (In Jamaica)

Dry your tears, have no fears
Fly Natty Dread
Fly Natty Dread

Help, help, help us tonight
Cast away that evil spell
Throw some water in the well

Feeling now, feeling down
This feeling wouldn't leave me alone
Then it came, the one that said
Hey Dread, Fly Natty Dread

Dry your tears, have no fears
Fly Natty Dread

In Jamaica...
