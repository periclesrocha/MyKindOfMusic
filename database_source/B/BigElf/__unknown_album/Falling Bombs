Mother told me not to worry they’re just falling bombs
She said she hasn’t heard that sound since back in Vietnam

Falling Bombs
They’re falling to the earth

Father told me that the world’s collapsing on us all
But television shows elapsing hides the writing on the wall

They’re just falling bombs
Who they falling on?
They’re just falling bombs
Till they’re falling on you

Are you gonna fly when you hear the sirens call?
Are you gonna die in a raging fire ball?
How you gonna live in a world that isn’t there?
Don’t you know there’s bombs’ falling through the air

Mother’s cooking in the kitchen she looks up to sky
She sees a fighter pilots mission and she wonders why

Falling Bombs
They’re falling to the earth

Father sees the situation starting to occur
But before he changed the station it was just another blur

They’re just falling bombs
Who they falling on?
They’re just falling bombs
Till they’re falling on you
