All these fried chicken wings that I’m serving
They make me yearn for your breats, legs, and thighs
My hunger for you is unswerving
Without you my heart starves, my heart dies

All these protests and speeches I’m making
To end all this chicken suffering and slaughter
His only response is that I’m faking
Yea, that I’m gay just like Dick Cheney’s daughter

My meat in your buns
Make such special sauce

Gay seems my way to quote Rober Frost

It could be nostalgia for all that is lost
Could be that our love is star crossed
Whoa-o-ah
I sure miss getting my salad tossed

’Cus you’re my fries
And your shake makes me shiver
You’re my happy meal sent from above
Can this drive-through called life deliver
A heavenly slow fast food love?

Since that night
All I have is self-pleasure
Bumping uglies real hard we did crying

With tissue and hand cream
I can try to remember
How you stuck this thing
How you stuck this thing up my behind

With my partner in bed I am yearning
To get pleasure and passion, that’s the truth
But only thoughts of you get me burning
Memories of your beef make me stew

If hearts were like chickens
Yours I’d defrost

To reclaim true love
What is the cost?

It could be nostalgia for all that is lost
Could be that our love is star crossed
Whoa-o-ah
I sure miss getting my salad tossed

’Cus you’re my fries
And your shake makes me shiver
You’re my happy meal sent from above
Can this drive-through called life deliver
A heavenly slow fast food love?

C’mon, deliver now!

’Cus you’re my fries
And your shake makes me shiver
You’re my happy meal sent from above
Can this drive-through called life deliver
A heavenly slow fast food love?

I wanna piece of you…

Shake me up
Toss my salad
