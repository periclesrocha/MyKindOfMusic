In 3B it's Diane
And she's makin' a plan
She says
I'm gonna change my hair
It just don't fit my face anymore
I'm gettin' out of here
I just don't like this place anymore
Tired of all the stallin'
This time it's for good

Come Monday
Come Monday
My life starts again
My new point of view is beginning
Come Monday
That one day
My ship's comin' in
And this time I'm ready to roll!
Come Monday
Come Monday

Now here's Ken in 5N
And he swears once again
He says
I'm gonna lose the weight
Gonna get into my clothes again
I'm gonna graduate
I'm gonna be the one who knows again

No more lame excuses
Then it's understood!

Come Monday
Come Monday
My life starts again
My new point of view is beginning
Come Monday
That one day
My ship's comin' in
And this time I'm ready to roll!
Come Monday
Come Monday

Come Monday
Come this Monday

Hey Bob, I'm changin' my job!
Hey man, I'm making a plan!
Yeah Slim, I'm joinin a gym!
And this time I'm ready to roll!

Come Monday
Come Monday
My life starts again
My new point of view is beginning

Come Monday
That one day
My ship's comin' in
And this time I'm ready to roll!

Come Monday
Come Monday
Come this Monday
Come this Monday
