Jah is my life and strength and energy
Gots to be smart to prevent them from
Tumble down on you

Tumble down on you, tumble down on you
Tumble, tumble, tumble, tumble, tumble
Tumble, tumble, tumble, tumble

People of the world, people of the world
Who see I works and know of I

Tumble down on you, tumble down on you
Tumble, tumble, tumble, tumble
Tumble, tumble, tumble, tumble

Backbiters want to tumble down on you

Criticism want to tumble down on you
Tumble down on you

Backbiters want to tumble down on you
Tumble down on you
Tumble, tumble, tumble, tumble
Tumble, tumble, tumble, tumble, tumble

Jah is my life and strength and energy
