And finally the silence,
looking out
looking back across the sky,
Trying to find a meaning,
knowing that I just left it all behind
Still I smell a lingering softness
Where did she go,
how did she go,
I wanna
I wanna know
I wanna know that she'll be coming
here to me

Come on,
without you
I'll never feel the love inside of me
Come On, you know that we belong
come on, come on, come on, come on

Thinking back before her,
I never knew the meaning of alone
Still the flag is feeling foreign,
I live the day to escape into a phone
Speaking of a world not real then
where did she go
how did she go,
I wanna
I wanna know
I wanna know that she'll be coming
here to me

Come on,
without you
I'll never feel the love inside of me
Come On, you know that we belong
come on, come on, come on, come on

Cause each of her kisses and my heart misses . . .
She's coming,
She's coming here to me,
I'm needing,
desiring to kiss her now,
I'm living for her,
breathing for her,
singing for her fairytale.

Come on,
without you
I'll never feel the love inside of me
Come On, you know that we belong
come on, come on, come on, come on

Come on,
without you
I'll never feel the love inside of me
come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on
