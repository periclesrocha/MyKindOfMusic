For all that I love you, that's how much I hate you
And it hits me like a flick of the switch
You're my perfect angel, but sometimes
All I see is a fuckin' bitch
The problem's not you, I know, it's true
There's just somethin' goin' on in my head
Everything has changed, everything's so strange
And now you're stuck with ab-normal again

For all that I love you, that's how much I hate you
And the button gets pushed all the time
For all the fun I have inside you
I could leave it at the toss of a dime
The problem's me, that much I see
There's something wrong inside my head
Everything has changed, everything's so strange
And now you're stuck with ab-normal again

For all that I love you, that's how much I hate you
And it crushes me like a ton of bricks
Just when I think I'm gonna reach out for your neck

Instead my hands go right to your tits
I've always known I'm crazy
I'm just tired of tryin' to pretend
Everything has changed, everything's so strange
And now you're stuck with ab-normal again

It's like runnin' face-first into a wall
Till I black out down on the floor
The next time ya see me chargin' towards ya
Just push me right out the door
The intensity's too much sometimes

Fame is a fuckin' cage
I'm infected with this rage
And now you're stuck with ab-normal again
And now you're stuck with ab-normal again
And now you're stuck with ab-normal again
And now we fuck like ab-normal again
