When a man gets trouble in his mind
He wanna sleep all the time
When a man gets trouble in mind
He wanna sleep all the time
He knows, he can't sleep all the time
He's trouble won't worry mind, won't worry his mind

I'm feelin' worried in mind
And I'm tryin-a keep from cryin'
I'm feelin' worried in mind
And I'm tryin-a keep from cryin'
I am standin' into sunshine
To keep from weakin' down, keep from weakin' down

I want somewhere to go
But I hate to go to town
I want somewhere to go
To satisfy my mind
I would go to town
But I hate to stand around, hate to stand around

I wonder what's the matter with my right mind?
My mind keep me sleepin' all the time
I wonder what's the matter with my right mind?
My mind keep me sleepin' all the time
But when I had plenty of money
My friend would come around, would come around

If I had my right mind
I would write my women a few lines
If I had my right mind
I would write my women a few lines
I will do most anything
To keep from weakin' down, keep from weakin' down
