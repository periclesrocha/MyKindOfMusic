Hanging round endlessly
Dog eat dog - dead end street

Brave new world
I can't break you down
I can see there is no way out
No way out

Wild and free in dead of night
I can dream - what I want I get
Out of touch with all that kitchen jive
Wildcat days - lonely nights
Lonely nights

Fair is foul - foul is fair
I cry out loud but there's no-one there
The more we live the most who die
Wildcat days - lonely nights
