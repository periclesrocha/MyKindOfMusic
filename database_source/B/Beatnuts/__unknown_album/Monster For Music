[Intro] [Psycho Les talking]
Yeah, this is for all my beat heads right here.
"Yeah you know how we comin'"
Yeah, hit me again with that shit.
"Yeah you know how we comin'"
{Girl talking}
Yo yo yo Les, how you comin' this time?
"Raw grooves with the funky drum drummin'"

[Verse One] [Psycho Les]
I might joke around
But you know my beats don't play money
I know you don't got money, so I know you trying to save money
At the same time a nigga like me, is trying to make money
You a greedy nigga so don't make me force my way in and take money
Out your stash
WHAT! You holding shit from me?
I'ma get it out your ass quick fast sonny
You like that fast money
Me? I'm looking for that long term money
Cause I loves to buuuurnn money
Niggas don't wanna work, but yet they wanna earrrn money
(Homeboy just want platinum)
Ayo that's none of my concern money
Tell me who can draw a tec and shoot you this quick? Who else gonna bring you that futuristic?
Exclusive
Fat and juicy, take a bite nigga
You'll see I'll knock your teeth out now you all lips like pussy
Lookin' mad as shit, haters wanna knock this
Fuck what you claim hip hop is
Fuck all your jewels and how flooded your watch is
You need to hit me with that funky shit non-stop kid

{girl talking}
Yo Les, that shit if funky. I like that shit.

You know why?

[Chorus]
I'ma Monster for music [x4]

[Verse Two] [Psycho Les]
Oh, you supposed to be the bomb now?
I think you and your label need to calm down
Yeah you nigga, with that corny song out
Who about to put it on now? (WHO)
Ju and Big Psych 'bout to put it down
And we don't give a fuck bout your bullshit style son You need to sit down, who coming with da shit now?
(Get down)
With some soul like James Brown
All these niggas shippin' gold I was like fuck the games now
Don't make me start callin names out(blowing brains out)
Niggas now the face now
So when I stick you, you on the floor face down Pullin' your head wondering if I left the place now
But hold up now, hold up, hold up
Before this songs through
I gotta another funky break for you
Hit it!

[Chorus]
I'ma Monster for music [x4]

[Outro]
Yo for real this shit is hot!
