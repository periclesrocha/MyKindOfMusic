Chorus:
ONE! TWO! We're coming for you. THREE! FOUR! Lock your door. FIVE! SIX! Suck on my ****. BROKENCYDE WILL NEVER DIE! (x2)

Verse 1:
Now I can feel the needle break, up inside of my veins. They try to tell me I'm insane, but they made me that way. So come and take me away, from this monster that you've made of me. I feel like dying, erasing all of these memoriesâ€¦

Bridge:
I'm trapped inside this cage tonight! You torture my brain with blades and knifes! I need you to try to save my life! BEFORE I GO INSANE! (x2)

Chorus:
ONE! TWO! We're coming for you. THREE! FOUR! Lock your door. FIVE! SIX! Suck on my ****. BROKENCYDE WILL NEVER DIE! (x2)

Verse 2:
In 7 days my schizophrenia breaks my brain cavity waves, distorted, decayed! These faces of insane originated this pain, and invented these demented ways to break me! Intoxicated, I'm faded inside my dreams. Motivated on defeating these haters in everything. It's the only thing that keeps me alive. It keeps me away from all of your mother fucking lies!!!

Bridge:
I'm trapped inside this cage tonight! You torture my brain with blades and knifes! I need you to try to save my life! BEFORE I GO INSANE! (x2)

Chorus:
ONE! TWO! We're coming for you. THREE! FOUR! Lock your door. FIVE! SIX! Suck on my ****. BROKENCYDE WILL NEVER DIE! (x2)

Verse 3:
I feel my nails rip my flesh; I feel I've gone insane. I never wanted to hurt you, but you made me this way. So now I know I'm crazy, I feel there's no more pain. These voices call out to me, they're screaming out my name.

Chorus:
ONE! TWO! We're coming for you. THREE! FOUR! Lock your door. FIVE! SIX! Suck on my ****. BROKENCYDE WILL NEVER DIE! (x4)
