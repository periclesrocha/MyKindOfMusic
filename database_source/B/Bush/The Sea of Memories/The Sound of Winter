Mind strong, body strong.
Try to find equilibrium.
Head straight, screwed on.
We screwed up, for too long.

Don’t wanna lean on the waves,
I watch the storm evaporate.
I think of you, in starry skies.
I keep you, so alive.

Let’s walk through the fire together,
Disappear in the golden sands.

It’s all in your face, I see you break.
It’s like the sound of winter.
Bleeding love, the silent escape.
You’ve got to hang on to yourself.
It’s like the sound of winter.

Medusa smiles, Judas’ lips.
Open arms and fingertips.
Love bites and recompense.
I’ll be with you, until the end.

Let’s walk through the fire together,
Disappear in the golden sands.

It’s all in your face, I see you break.
It’s like the sound of winter.
Bleeding love, the silent escape.
You’ve got to hang on to yourself.

It’s all in your face, I see you break.
It’s like the sound of winter.
Bleeding love, the silent escape.
You’ve got to hang on to yourself.
It’s like the sound of winter.

Hang on to yourself.
Hang on to yourself.

It’s like the sound of winter.

It’s all in your face, I see you break.
It’s like the sound of winter.
Bleeding love, the silent escape.
You’ve got to hang on to yourself.
It’s like the sound of winter.

It’s like the sound of winter.

Hang on to yourself.
Hang on to yourself.
