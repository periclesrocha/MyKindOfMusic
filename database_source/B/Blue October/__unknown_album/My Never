Will you think of me in time?
It's never my luck so never mind
I wanna say your name
But the pain starts again
It's never my luck so never mind

I had a dream that you were with me
It wasn't my fault
You rolled me over, flipped me over
Like a somersault.
That doesn't happen to me
I've never been here before
But I saw forever in my never
And I stood outside her heaven

Will you wait for me in time?
It's never my luck so never mind
I've lost a lot of what I don't expect to ever return
I tend to push them till the pushing's turned from hurt into burn
I always take them to that place they thought they wanted to go
Then end up dancing round, this clown commands applause at his show

I had a dream that you were with me
It wasn't my fault
You rolled me over, flipped me over
A somersault
That doesn't happen to me
I've never been here before
I saw forever in my never
And I stood outside her heaven
Heaven, heaven, heaven

I can only dream of you and sleep but I'd never see sunlight again
I can try to be with you, but somehow I'll end up just losing a friend
I can only reach for you, relate to you, I'm losing my friend
Where did she go? Where?

I had a dream that you were with me
It wasn't my fault
You rolled me over, flipped me over
Like a somersault
That doesn't happen to me
I've never been here before
I saw forever in my never
And I stood outside her heaven
I stood outside her heaven

Would you let me in your heaven?
I wanna live inside your heaven
