(My knees touch the floor. The couch is nice and soft and possibly velvet of the lightest color blue.
I’m telling him to kill me. I’m looking him straight in the headlights, man: "I want you to kill me"

How many ways can I say it?
Everybody knows what I’m talking about!

I’ve been biting my lips, again.
I’ve just been waiting, again.

It’s all so funny, it’s never been this fucking funny before.
His teeth are one of the better parts,
I like seeing them, his eyes close up a little when they come out.
His fingers are so long, like I never noticed before.

I’m just sitting here, looking for pressure points,
but really I just want to take his hands and place them in my mouth,
really just want him to push his thumbs deep into my neck. I’m not kidding brother…)

Swing with me now
Tell me you will be okay
Swing with me now
Tell me you will go away
