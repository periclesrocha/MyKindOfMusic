Hey there Country Girl
Don’t go home
Don’t go home
Don’t go home

He says Hey Girl
It ain’t the same
They’ve all changed
It ain’t the same

Hey there Country Girl
Don’t be sad
You got what you wanted
Don’t be sad
Don’t be sad

Don’t be

Think about crying
You were a child
Way back when
You were so wild

For that kiss
You could go crying
For that kiss
You would go crying

Nothing like that way you used to feel

Don’t sulk away
misty street light
I need you to stay

Remember that promise
in the middle of the night

My heart’s on fire
when you go away

When I ask - I want you to stay
When I ask - I want you to stay

Please

Don’t leave me alone here
In the dusty small town
There’s no one near
My heart’s on fire

Watch it burn

Hey there Country Girl
Don’t go home
Don’t go home
Don’t go home

He says Hey Girl
It ain’t the same
They’ve all changed
It ain’t the same

Hey there Country Girl
Don’t be sad
It’s what you wanted
Don’t be sad

Don’t be sad

Now so different
and so mild
Just to find the body
a humble body

Only for that kiss
