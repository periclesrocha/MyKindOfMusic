It’s electric
where you find it
then you touch it
but it falls down

It’s electric
where you find it
and you touch it
but it falls down

Huh!

There’s a man there
in my hands here
with his mouth
slightly ajar -

When I reach down
and I touch it
I know I’ve gone
too far.

Ah!

Huh!

It’s electric
where you find it
and you touch it
but it falls down

It’s electric
where you find it
then you touch it
but it falls down

Huh!

It’s electric
where you find it
and you touch it
but it falls down

There’s a girl there
in my dreams here
with the auburn hair
and she’s stuck

Underneath

Oh she’s stuck
underneath me

and there’s nothing I
can do
about it.
