Remember that night,
you took me away?

Went so fast,
I flew away.

The sky was black,
My hair was fire -

Touched your leg,
Let’s drive forever.

Remember that thought
you had in the night?

Tired of talking - let’s
disappear -

You touch the wheel,
we fly off the road.

Close your eyes,
it will all be over.

I said:

Let’s drive forever

Let’s drive forever

It’s a hard feeling
you can’t walk away from

You’re a hard feeling
I can’t walk away from

Remember that night,
you drove me away?

I pretended you,
were the only way.

In your car
I want you forever.

Kissed your mouth
let’s drive forever.

I said -

Remember that night
you took me away?

Went so fast,
I flew away.

Sky was black,
my hair was fire
Touched your leg,
Let’s drive forever

I said.
