Be the moan
In the rain
By the fallen hand
That waves goodbye

Be that blade
That takes me out
When I understand
Understand

“Help,” she says
See the past
Or what’s left of me
Wants to be

She was once
A block of stone
In her younger years
Now she’s gone

Don’t fade away
Don’t fade away

It’s too late
In this hell
To save yourself
I can tell

There’s one day
You won’t know
Who I was
Where I go

So cut me off
Break the spell

We cry
We fight
For our yesterday

Don’t fade away

Fade away
Don’t
Fade away

Shut your mouth
I will say
I miss you
Everyday
