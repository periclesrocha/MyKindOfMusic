Take me down to LA
I wanna go down
I wanna go down

Will you want me yesterday?
I’ve been hiding in your room,
Just hiding in that room.

I will hurt you either way
It’s a matter of my time
Just a matter of my, my time

Do you even know
what I want
what I hold
tonight?
Tonight.

Take me down to LA
I wanna see you
I wanna see you

Will you want me either way?
I’ve been hiding in your mind,
Just hiding in that mind.

You will hurt me either way
It’s a matter of your time
I’m a mattter of your, your time (your time)

Ah.

Stop! Using me.
Stop! Using me.

I wanna feel you
I wanna feel

Stop! Using me.

I wanna feel you
I wanna feel

Tonight
Tonight

Do you even know
What I want
What I hold
Tonight?

Take me down to LA
I wanna go down
I wanna go down

Will you want me yesterday?
I’ve been hiding in your room,
Just hiding in that room.

You will hurt me either way
You’re only in my mind
You’re only in my mind

Do you even know
what I want
what I hold
tonight?
Tonight.
