I’ve not been well
Been falling over

As far as I can tell
You’re pulling one over

You’re killing me here
Tonight
In my own room

You’re taking me there
Tonight

I calm my breath
In the blur of that night
In her coat

And she smokes

She holds
Me for
A little while

Let’s pretend it’s easy
Not to say (why)

Now we take the famous drive
Open windows and I’m alive

I’m somebody’s fool!
Can you love me
The way that I love you?
An endless ache

In your daddy’s car
We can run away
Leave this town behind

Never take that hope away

Somebody’s fool
I hate you

When I dream
It’s your hands

But I can’t
See them

In bed,
My sight — my throat
My high

When you ask me baby
Who you wanna be?
Who you wanna be?

I’m the one that holds you
in the middle of the night.

I’m the one that wants you
forever till we die.

So it’s time we take
all the memories away —

I’m the one that holds you
in the middle of the night.

Who you wanna be?
Who you wanna be?
Who you wanna be?
Who you wanna be?
Who you wanna be?
Who you wanna be?
Who you wanna be?
