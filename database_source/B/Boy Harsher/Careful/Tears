Do you feel uncomfortable?
What’s this version
Of your life?

You only come
When spoken to
But, you follow with the knife

To feel, that fear
My blood - it runs clear

You make me feel like falling through
I disappear, in my mind

Hate body
Hate body
Hate body
Hate body
Hate body
Hate body
Hate body
Hate body

(Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?
Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?)

What’s this horse
You’re beating down?
Self restraint in her eyes.

I left this place so long ago,
but your face keeps it alive.

To feel, that fear,
my blood - it runs clear.

You make feel like giving up.
I disappear, in the lies.

(Just walk away, just walk away,
just walk away, just walk away,
just walk away, walk away,
walk away, walk away,
walk away, just walk away)
