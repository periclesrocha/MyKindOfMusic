You’re always running
Always running away
Ever wonder
Ever want to say

What’s the fantasy
Meant to mean?
Just to flee
Far from here!

Hey Fate,
What do you think you’re trying
To prove
Think you’re trying
To prove?

Ain’t got time
Ain’t got skin
For the lies
Again
For the lies
Again

Hi hi
Oh no
In spite of me
You always go

Forget the crying
Tempt the pain
Hi hi
Gone again

Hi hi
Oh no
In spite of me
You always go

Forget the crying
Tempt the pain
Hi hi
Gone again

Baby, I might be late
It might be strange
To come back
To your arms!

Hey Fate,
What do you think you’re trying
To prove
Think you’re trying
To prove?

Ain’t got the time
Ain’t got skin
For the lies
Again
For the lies

Hi hi
Oh no
In spite of me
You always go

Forget the crying
Tempt the pain
Hi hi
Gone again

Hi hi
Oh no
In spite of me
You always go

Forget the crying
Tempt the pain
Hi hi
Gone again

Gone again

Hi hi

Hi hi

Hi hi
