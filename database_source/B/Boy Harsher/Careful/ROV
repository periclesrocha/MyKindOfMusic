I felt your heart beat
To the rhythm of violence
I felt your heart beat
To the question of everything

What you do
Not what you are
What you say
Somebody save me

Come on in
Come on in
Come on
With the rebel by my side

I felt your heart beat
To the rhythm of violence
I felt your heart beat
To the question of everything

When the gun falls
It falls down
And my rebel was on the ground

When they come
They come for me
Let him fall
Just to keep me free

I felt your heart beat
To the rhythm of violence
I felt your heart beat
To the question of everything

How you come
Not how you leave
Coming in
Only to save me

Come on in
Come on in
Come on
With the rebel by my side

To the rhythm of violence
To the question of everything
