When you go
I will be
all alone

What’s left of you
Is left in me
in this home

I close my eyes
And I can
almost see

The look you gave
when you
you ran from me

The way you call
The way you walk
You walk in me

Believing you
Is leaving me
when I bend

And all the boys,
and what they say
on your own

And I know,
I know,
it’s been done

I close my eyes
and I can
almost see

The look you gave
when you
you ran from me

I wanna know
I wanna know
where you’ve been

You’re coming home
You’re coming home
just tell me when

I needa know
when I will be —
by your side

I close my eyes
and I can
almost see

The look you gave
when you
you ran from me

Close my eyes
and I can
almost see

The look you gave
when you
you ran from me
