Big Bad John
I need you now

Big Bad John
I love you now

One great man
Always lived in my fantasy

One great man
Taught me how to not be afraid

Big Bad John
There’s a reason you live on

Big Bad John
I’m not afraid, no one’s afraid

No one’s afraid now

Big Bad John

He’s the only man to follow
He’s the only man to follow
He’s the only man to follow
He’s the only man to follow

There’s darkness all around me
There’s darkness all around me
There’s darkness all around me
Darkness all around me

But I am not afraid
I am not afraid
I am not afraid
I am not afraid

With the switch of a blade
With the switch of a blade
With the switch of a blade
With the switch of a blade

He took me
He took me
He took me
He took me

Big Bad
Big Bad…
Big Bad
Big Bad…
