Big eyes look up wondering:
whatcha doing here kid, whatcha, whatcha doing here?

Sitting in the middle of a bar on the wrong side
On the wrong side of the tracks

Get her a drink, a whisky, a bourbon
Can she handle it?
Can she handle it?

Looks up at you with the red lips
She says
She says
She says

Don’t you
Don’t you wanna save me
From my mean old man?

Don’t you
Don’t you wanna save me
From my shithole of a town?

Get the car, let’s go (get the car, let’s go)
Let’s run away
All I need is someone who’ll pay

All I need
Is someone who’ll pay

Don’t you
Don’t you
Don’t you
Don’t you
Don’t you
Don’t you
Don’t you
Don’t you

Three days later
Alone in the woods
Something, something ain’t right

Baby sitting by your side alone in the car
She cries
She cries

Don’t you
Don’t you
Don’t you
Don’t you

Don’t you
Don’t you wanna save yourself
From the end of time?

Get the car, let’s go (get the car, let’s go)
Let’s run away
All I need is someone who’ll pay

Get the car, let’s go (get the car, let’s go)
Let’s run away
All I need is someone who’ll pay
