Hers was a sorrow so hard felt
It filled the rivers
And the mill

Took my baby
Down to the sand
Where she flooded it
She flooded my land

She’s the water in a deep well
So deep
I couldn’t tell
So deep
I could not tell

She said
She said

I’m crawling
I’m crawling
I’m crawling

In the desert
We will find our way
Without reason
Or means to pay

Why does she keep dreaming of the past?
He won’t consider it, it won’t last
Why do they keep saying it’s okay?

She’s a river
I’m floating away

In the desert
She knelt down
And the water flowed
Down to the ground

In the desert
She let it all go
And her misery
Took control

Deep deep well
Deepest well

She’s gonna drown me
She’s gonna drown me
In her misery
