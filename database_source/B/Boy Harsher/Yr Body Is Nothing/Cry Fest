I think they might be
Might be fooling us

They say I am a believer
But don’t you know, don’t know
I know nothing

I think they might be fooling us

They gonna take us down
Oh, they gonna pull me down

Don’t you know, don’t you know
There’s nowhere to go anymore
There’s nowhere to go

My body’s been telling me
The wrong thing this whole time
And I can’t stop it

My feet keep moving forward
But I am not doing anywhere
I just can’t stop it
Oh I can’t stop it

Here I am scaring myself
Thinking things over
I’m just thinking things over

I think they may be fooling us

My feet just keep moving forward
And I’m telling them to stop it
Stop it, stop it, stop it

My feet just keep moving forward
And I’m telling them to stop it
Stop it, stop it, stop it

My feet just keep moving forward
And I’m telling them to stop it
Stop it, stop it
