Who am I?
Who am I?

Clutching the wheel with both hands
I’m learning how to drive

My heart is racing
Rising
It’s how we survive

There’s a realness to the hands
That pull you away
There’s a realness to the voice
That asks you to stay

You’re the door that keeps closing
Closing on me

I’m the heart
Always broken
Broken by that sound

It is not enough
It is not enough
It’s never enough

It is not enough
It is not enough
It’s never enough

Please don’t go

So let’s drive

So let’s drive

Watching the wind with both eyes
I’m moving away

Clutching the wheel with both hands
I’m running away

Please don’t go
You’ll never stay
