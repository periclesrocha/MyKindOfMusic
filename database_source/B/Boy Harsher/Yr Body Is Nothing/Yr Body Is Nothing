What do you want from me?
What can I give you?

What do you want from me?
What can I give you?

All alone
In the club
It’s where I found you
It must be love

It’s dark
Your body’s naked
Lights are red
You’re pouring sweat

Oh, it’s dark
Your body’s naked
Lights are red
You’re pouring sweat

(Ah…)

It’s late September
And I miss you
He doesn’t know where I go
In the daytime
With my eyes closed
And I want you
In the sun

It could be simple
We could walk away
But we know better
There’s reason to stay

It’s dark
Your body’s naked
Lights are red
You’re pouring sweat

Oh, it’s dark
Your body’s naked
Lights are red
You’re pouring sweat

It’s dark
I never held you in my arms

I prefer the young girl’s face
I prefer the young girl’s face
Not like mine
Without a trace

I prefer your lover’s face
Your lover’s face
Your lover’s face

It’s dark
Your body’s naked
Lights are red
You’re pouring sweat

Oh, it’s dark
Your body’s naked
Lights are red
You’re pouring sweat

It’s dark
Your body’s naked
Lights are red
You’re pouring sweat

Oh, it’s dark
Your body’s naked
Lights are red
You’re pouring sweat

(Ah…)
