In the dark, we don’t know
How it hurts, when you leave so slow

This is where I say I’m sorry
You let me down
Let me down

You come out to the show
And you left me there
You had to go
Made my body feel so cold
You left me there, all alone
All alone

Don’t watch me fall

How come you want what you can’t see?
You can only see me
You can only see me

I can’t hide from your disappointment
I can’t run from what you want

I am not that person that you want
It’s not me
It’s not me

Don’t watch me fall
Don’t watch me fall
Watch me fall
Watch me fall
Watch me fall
