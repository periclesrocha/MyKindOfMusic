What is it that you are doing here?
I know, I don’t know
What is it that you are doing dear?
I know, I don’t know

I am gonna follow you tonight
All the way, all the way home
I am gonna find you in the night
All the way, all the way home

You see me you see a stranger
I see you and see danger

Pain, always pain
Pain, always pain

Pain breaks the rhythm, breaks the rhythm, breaks the rhythm, pain
Pain breaks the rhythm, breaks the rhythm, breaks the rhythm, pain
Pain breaks the rhythm, breaks the rhythm, breaks the rhythm, pain
Pain breaks the rhythm, breaks the rhythm, breaks the rhythm, pain
Pain breaks the rhythm, breaks the rhythm, breaks the rhythm, pain
Pain breaks the rhythm, breaks the rhythm, breaks the rhythm, pain
Pain breaks the rhythm, breaks the rhythm, breaks the rhythm, pain
Pain breaks the rhythm, breaks the rhythm, breaks the rhythm, pain

Pain breaks the rhythm, breaks the rhythm, breaks the rhythm, pain
Pain breaks the rhythm, breaks the rhythm, breaks the rhythm, pain
Pain breaks the rhythm, breaks the rhythm, breaks the rhythm, pain
Pain breaks the rhythm, breaks the rhythm, breaks the rhythm, pain
Pain breaks the rhythm, breaks the rhythm, breaks the rhythm, pain
Pain breaks the rhythm, breaks the rhythm, breaks the rhythm, pain
Pain breaks the rhythm, breaks the rhythm, breaks the rhythm, pain
Pain breaks the rhythm, breaks the rhythm, breaks the rhythm, pain

Where were you when I was out alone
I know, I don’t know
You had me in your thoughts for so long
So it goes, so it goes

I am needing this from you tonight
Your side, your dark side
I want you to turn off the light
Your side, your dark side

Pain, I love pain
Pain, I love pain
Pain, I love pain
Pain, I love pain

Pain breaks the rhythm, breaks the rhythm, breaks the rhythm, pain
Pain breaks the rhythm, breaks the rhythm, breaks the rhythm, pain
Pain breaks the rhythm, breaks the rhythm, breaks the rhythm, pain
Pain breaks the rhythm, breaks the rhythm, breaks the rhythm, pain
Pain breaks the rhythm, breaks the rhythm, breaks the rhythm, pain
Pain breaks the rhythm, breaks the rhythm, breaks the rhythm, pain
Pain breaks the rhythm, breaks the rhythm, breaks the rhythm, pain
Pain breaks the rhythm, breaks the rhythm, breaks the rhythm, pain
