I’m not the girl you thought you knew
Take some time to work it through
I’m not that person in the night
I’m not that person in the night

Must’ve been fooled by my face
In the dark I could be anyone
Someone out there to take my place
Someone out there to take my place

I bet it is this gal I know
Something happens when she looks at me
I wish that I could let it go
I wish that I could let it go

Run, run, run
Run, run

Run, run, run
You better run

Run, run, run
Run, run

I’m not that person in the night
I’m not that person in the night
I’m not that person in the night
In the dark I could be anyone

(Mmm…)

(Mmm…)

Run, run, run
Run, run

Ain’t no one
Ain’t no one

You better run
You better run
You better run
Run, run

Ain’t no one
Ain’t no one

(Mmm…)
