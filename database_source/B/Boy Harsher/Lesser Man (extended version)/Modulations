What does it take
To pull you open
To pull you open

What does it take
To push you out there
To push you out there

I’m waiting for
An instigation
An instigation

Ya!

Take me there
I wanna go
Take me there
But take it slow

Take my hand
Take it off
Take my time
Let’s get off

And this is what the girls say:
Nooooooo, noooooo, noooo
Nooooo, noooo

In the dark
We lose our shape
Take my heart
Call it rape

Darkness renders
Darkness hides

Take me there
I wanna go

And this is what the girls say:
I…
I!

Take me there
I wanna go
Take me there
But take it slow

Let’s go
Let’s go
Let’s go
Let’s go

And this is what the girls say:
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!

Let’s go
Let’s go
Let’s go
Let’s go

No!
