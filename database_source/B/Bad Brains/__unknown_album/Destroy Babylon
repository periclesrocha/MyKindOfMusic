Don't beat yourself upside the head. Don't beat yourself for this. Don't beat yourself upside the head, don't beat yourself for this. Oh, there is a way out. It's a natural plan, the natural. How many days do we sit around, while they keep on burying all our leaders in the ground. Organize, centralize. It's time for us to fight for our lives. Destroy Babylon. Oh there is a way.
