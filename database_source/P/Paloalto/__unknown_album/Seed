This is taking all
My thoughts run deep
It cracks my bones, it shakes my teeth
With it my skin pulls from here
Right out of this
It looks like rain, it tastes like steel
It goes so slow, I don't know if it's real
It shapes like fire, it burns right in
That place

Carry that seed
Carry that seed
Carry that seed

This is a mental thief who's cracking up
And brings my face a holy grin
And ties it down with imbeciles
I'm looking for this hiding place
I'm hanging onto this course
Like me

Carry that seed
Carry that seed
Carry that seed

Carry that seed
Carry that seed
Carry that seed
Carry that seed
Carry that seed
