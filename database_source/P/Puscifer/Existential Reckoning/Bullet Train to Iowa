Say bye-bye, kneel down
Yield, pray, and kiss the ground
Gonna be a while before we touch back down
Ain't no turning back
Like a train sprouting wings, fuck the track
Hello, sky... I'm all aboard this surprise locomotion
Oh my. Oh well. Guess I'd better just enjoy the ride

My, oh my
Grinning and chatty tapestries and tile
I'll, I'll try to keep this conversation light
May be up all night
And I surmise there might have been
Ayahuasca hiding in the water and wine
Water and wine
Looks like I'm about to take a bullet train to
Ayahuasca soon
Well, all right
Ride, ride
Choo-choo-choo
Choo-choo-choo
Animistical wayside Sabbatical

Say bye bye

Gonna be a while before we touch back down
Hello, Sky! I'm all aboard this surprise locomotion
Oh my. Oh well. Guess I'll... (pray, kneel and kiss the ground)
Gonna be awhile before we touch back down
Ain't no turning back
Like a train sprouting wings, fuck the track
Hello, sky... I'm all aboard this surprise locomotion
Oh my. Oh well. Guess I'd better just enjoy the ride

Ride

Ride, ride, ride, ride
