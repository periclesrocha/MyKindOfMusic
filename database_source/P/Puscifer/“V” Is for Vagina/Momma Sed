Wake up, son of mine
Momma got something to tell you

Changes come
Life will have its way
With your pride, son
Take it like a man

Hang on, son of mine
A storm is blowing up your horizon

Changes come
Keep your dignity
Take the high road
Take it like a man

Listen up, son of mine
Momma got something to tell you

All about growing pains
Life will pound away
Where the light don’t shine, son
Take it like a man

Suck it up, son of mine
Thunder blowing up your horizon

Changes come (changes come)
Keep your dignity (keep your dignity)
Take the high road, oh (take the high road)
Take it like a man (take it like a man)

Momma said like the rain (this, too, shall pass)
Like a kidney stone (this, too, shall pass)
It’s just a broken heart, son
This pain will pass away
