When the night is closing
Eyes are running wild
Then I hear you humming
All night long

The sign — I see it
Tell me, am I true?
All I need from you is
All I see

The city’s paved with cold
Playboys buying fun
Seems there is no hunter
Left without his hunting gun

Can you feel the light?
The air is wild, open
Oh, you see the light — it’s coming through
It’s there in the distance
Always offered to me
Always coming over a hill

Oh, your see-saw smile
Lasts me all night long
Like a siren’s curl
When the night is long

Now, come hold my hand
No bad vibe hearts
Hold my hand, you know
This journey could be long

Yeah, the seasons come in
All the nights are woven
All the nights, we’ll see them through
Ah, no hundred men now
Would dare cut into us
We’ll go on and see it through

[Belle
Une rose qui a joue son role
Mon miroir
Mon clef d’or
Mon cheval
Et mon gant sont les cinq secrets de ma puissance]

Now hold my hand
No bad vibe hearts

[Je voulais livrer
Il vous suffira de mettre ce gant
A votre main droite
Il vous transportera ou vous desirez l’etre]

When the night has come in
Your eyes are running wild
Then I hear you humming over
All night long

Yeah, the sign — I see it
Yeah, the times — I see it
All I need to know from you
Is all I see

Can you feel the light?
The air is wild, open
Oh you see the light
It’s coming through

It’s there in the distance
Always offered to me
Always coming over a hill

Yeah, the seasons come in
All the nights are woven
All the nights, we’ll see them through

Ah, no hundred men now
Would dare cut into us
We’ll go on and see it through

Can you feel the light?
The air is wild, open
Oh you see the light —
It’s coming through

It’s there in the distance
Always offered to me
Always coming over a hill

Yeah, the seasons come in
All the nights are woven
All the nights, we’ll see them through

Ah, no hundred men now
