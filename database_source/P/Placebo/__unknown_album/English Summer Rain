Always stays the same
Nothing ever changes
English summer rain
Seems to last for ages

Always stays the same
Nothing ever changes
English summer rain
Seems to last for ages

I'm in the basement
You're in the sky
I'm in the basement baby
Drop on by

I'm in the basement
You're in the sky
I'm in the basement baby
Drop on by

Always stays the same
Nothing ever changes
English summer rain
Seems to last for ages

Always stays the same
Nothing ever changes
English summer rain
Seems to last for ages

I'm in the basement
You're in the sky
I'm in the basement baby
Drop on by

I'm in the basement
You're in the sky
I'm in the basement baby
Drop on by

Hold your breath and count to ten
Then fall apart and start again
Hold your breath and count to ten
Start again start again

Hold your breath and count to ten
Then fall apart and start again
Start again
Start again
Start again
Start again
Start again
Start again
Start again
Start again
Start again
Start again
Start again
Start again
Start again

Always stays the same
Nothing ever changes
English summer rain
Seems to last for ages

Always stays the same
Nothing ever changes
English summer rain
Seems to last for ages

Hold your breath and count to ten
Then fall apart and start again
Hold your breath and count to ten
Start again start again

Hold your breath and count to ten
Then fall apart and start again
Hold your breath and count to ten
Start again start again

Start again
Start again
Start again
Start again
Start again
Start again
Start again
Start again
Start again
Start again
Start again

(in single ver)
And I can't sleep without your breathing
And I can't breathe each time you're leaving
And I pray you won't stay away
That you come back to me some day
