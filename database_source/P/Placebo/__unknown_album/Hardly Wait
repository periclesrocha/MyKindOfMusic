I can hardly wait
I can hardly wait
I can hardly wait
I can hardly wait
It's been so long I've lost my taste
Say angel come, say lick my face
Let fall your dress
I'll play the part
I'll open this mouth wide, eat your heart

I can hardly wait...
Lips cracked dry
Tongue blue burst
Say angel come, said lick my thirst
It's been so long I've lost my taste
Here romeo, make my world as great

In my glass coffin I'm waiting
In my glass coffin I'm waiting
In my glass coffin I'm waiting...
