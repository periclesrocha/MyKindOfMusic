Image reflected
How could you know?
The hours I was wasting
Careful to move slow

Image reflected
I am exposed
The fear that I am losing
You to the unknown

Power for nothing
We give it for… free
Sacrifice yourself
Cave in to me

Power for nothing
We give it for… free
Sacrifice yourself
Cave in to me

Image reflected
What have we lost?
Love is the highest ask
When we destroy ourselves

Image reflected
You need to know
Your highs are mine and I take them
Your lows, my lowest lows

Power for nothing
We give it for… free
Sacrifice yourself
Cave in to me

Power for nothing
We give it for… free
Sacrifice yourself
Cave in to me

Power for nothing
We give it for… free
Sacrifice yourself
Cave in to me

Power for nothing
We give it for… free
Sacrifice yourself
Cave in to me
