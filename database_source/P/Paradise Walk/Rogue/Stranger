Under the cover of love
In the darkest shadows of our hearts
There was a fire that burned like a star
And now my heart is a stranger
And now my heart is a stranger

I can see that look in your eyes
There is a fear that this could be real
I still taste the serpent’s kiss
When you’re close, you’re close to me

And your ghosts, are calling you out
And your ghosts, they’re calling you out

Under the cover of love
In the darkest shadows of our hearts
There was a fire that burned like a star
And now my heart is a stranger
And now my heart is a stranger

Can you stand to look in a mirror?
Can you face what’s there staring back?
Or is there a fear that this is all real?
Will you step up and face your past?

I think it’s time we admit who we are
I think it’s time we admit who we are
I think it’s time we admit who we are
I think it’s time we admit who we are

Under the cover of love
In the darkest shadows of our hearts
There was a fire that burned like a star
And now my heart is a stranger
And now my heart is a stranger

Under the cover of love
In the darkest shadows of our hearts
There was a fire that burned like a star
And now my heart is a stranger
And now my heart is a stranger
