You don’t know, you don’t know my name
I am a Rogue, I am the fear that lies in your heart
You just keep on running faster, running through the night
But you’re out of time
If you can’t believe what you see
Then believe me when I say there’s no turning back
Believe me when I say there’s no turning back

I’ll never let you win
But now it’s too late to turn around
Something has changed in me
I am the darkness in the light
I will trade your blood
I will trade your blood for salt water
And watch you sink to the bottom of the sea

You are the prey, I am the hunter
I am a Rogue, I am the horror that will tear you apart
You just keep on reaching out, reaching through the dark
But there’s nothing to find
We will have our vengeance tonight

We will have vengeance tonight
We will have vengeance tonight
We will have vengeance tonight

I’ll never let you win
But now it’s too late to turn around
Something has changed in me
I am the darkness in the light
I will trade your blood
I will trade your blood for salt water
And watch you sink to the bottom of the sea
