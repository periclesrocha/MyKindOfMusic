The darkness takes a hold
Another city will fall
Another city will fall (city will fall)
It’ll take what’s left of us
Before it tears down the walls
Before it tears down the walls (tear down the walls)
We stand toe-to-toe without a second thought
We’re ready to fight
For that’s all that we’ve got
With all the blood that’s been shed, amongst the sands of time
How do we make it right?
How do we make it right? (don’t trust anymore)

Another city will fall

I will face the horror
So that you can turn away,
Turn away
So if I carry or am carried upon my shield,
I’m still between the Devil,
And the deep blue sea.

I am not alone,
I stand here with my brothers, with a will of steel.
But our hands, they still tremble because,
A man’s home is not here, through the smoke and mirrors,
We are men not machines, but we are just another piece.

I am cold, and I fear tonight, (and I fear)
We won’t get a second chance.

I am cold, and I fear,
We won’t get a second chance.
