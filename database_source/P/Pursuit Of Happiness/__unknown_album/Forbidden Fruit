Why do men chosoe evil
Why do men choose pain
Why do I choose to see you again
Why do your eyes tempt me
Why do I want you so much
I know your body would break me, so I won't touch
Forbidden fruit - the taste of sorrow
There'll be no turning back
You can't go back
Forbidden fruit - the taste of sorrow
I try to avoid you
We can't be left alone
If I could just undress you, that's as far as I'd go
It makes me feel so guilty
I feel so ashamed
Maybe I'll go outside and wash you off me in the rain
