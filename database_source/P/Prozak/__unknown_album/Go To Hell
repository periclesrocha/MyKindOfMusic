If it's hate that you speak
(Go to hell!)
And if you prey upon the weak
(Go to hell!)
Spreadin' lies and deciets
(Go to hell!)
Eternal flames, feel the heats
(Go to hell!)
And if you cannot make amends
(Go to hell!)
And if you follow every trend
(Go to hell!)
And if you back stab your friends
(Go to hell!)
If you ain't down 'til the end
(Go to hell!)

The chosen one, the wicked son, they call Hitchcock
Talk some shit and I'ma hit you with this quick block
Body parts are scattered and sealed up in ziplocks
With my steel cats get ill'd up to six blocks
You can try to run away but you won't get far
They call me Prozak, BITCH!, the knight of Templar
I'll open up your brain like the Deathstar
And lyrics come to me like ghosts from the graveyard

Since my birth I've been obsessed with the dead
Homocidal thoughts while I was bein' breast fed
I tried to kill myself but I survived instead
From pieces of a broken mirror, sliced my wrists, bled

Shit, my wicked rhymes will have you overdose
I'll leave your ass comatose
You try to play me close I'll levitate the smoke
When I hit the fuckin' stage be like, "What's that smell?"
Sulfer and brimstone BITCH, go to hell

If it's hate that you speak
(Go to hell!)
And if you pray upon the weak
(Go to hell!)
Spreadin' lies and deciets
(Go to hell!)
Eternal flames, feel the heats
(Go to hell!)
And if you cannot make amends
(Go to hell!)
And if you follow every trend
(Go to hell!)
And if you back stab your friends
(Go to hell!)
If you ain't down 'til the end
(Go to hell!)

They call me Hitchcock
The radios afraid to play my wicked paragraphs
Go to the station lock and load up on they whole staff
And let them know the danger of us crossin' paths
And let it be known that I spit the truth like a polygraph
So jot it down homie, copy that
There's always room for another carbon copycat
They tried to run with my style but I got it back
It's hard to sound just like me with your head in half
(Go to hell!)

If it's hate that you speak
(Go to hell!)
And if you pray upon the weak
(Go to hell!)
Spreadin' lies and deciets
(Go to hell!)
Eternal flames, feel the heats
(Go to hell!)
And if you cannot make amends
(Go to hell!)
And if you follow every trend
(Go to hell!)
And if you back stab your friends
(Go to hell!)
If you ain't down 'til the end
(Go to hell!)
