I'm too cynical
a simple individual
just trying to make residual
my momma says that I'm too critical
I used to be the kid that
everybody else was mocking
I started rapping cause
nobody listened when I'm talking
we were the niggas munching paki in class
and now we drunk off sake
while she dropping her ass
sip sip
my mouth is bleeding
you can see it
drip from my lower lip
I don't give a shit
I just need a hit
please get off my dick tip
Picture Perfect, cam and char
but you know who it is
two kids, one midi
oh you never heard of 'em
shit no kidding
everybody stand
Imma stay sitting in the city
that i swear is out to get me
so when I die no one forget me
the song is setting
curtains closed
everybody had a home
and I got nowhere to go
my mum in California
my sister moved to Florida
it seems like yesterday
I was begging her for some quarters
to buy a soda from a machine
that don't exist no more
cause they went and tore it up
this ain't no Comine this ain't Midoria
this is Cam Bolden
everything I say is all the shit that
I beholding in my heart, in my brain
you all know, I feel insane
I'm out of time, I'm out of mind
but when my fam call
I tell them that I feel fine
cause I don't wanna freak em out
but if they hear this song they gone be freaked out
I'm sorry mum I'm not a liar
I'm just a kid with some weed and a lighter
jokes I smoked once and had a panic attack
when I got home
but I ain't tell my niggas that
keep my hands in my motherfucking pockets
when I'm walking
locked to the sidewalk like a cyclops
momma told me keep my head held high
I told her sorry momma
I can never be that guy
so Imma let the beat ride
Fuck
Empty verses, always lurking
Picture Perfect, is it worth it?
if I die will any niggas be hurting
I know y'all tired of the sad shit
but that's just who I am
so you're just going to have to look past it
and sit the fuck down
shut the fuck up
I'm tired of these niggas
trying tell me what's up
bitch I'm whats up
bitch I'm that guy
I'm that nigga with the fire in his eyes
so Imma let that fucking beat ride
Fuck

I'm always losing myself, losing myself,
losing myself, inside my mind
don't run away and hide
from all the feelings you provide
I'm always losing myself, losing myself,
losing myself, inside my mind
don't run away and hide
from all the feelings you provide
I'm always losing myself, losing myself,
losing myself, inside my mind
don't run away and hide
from all the feelings you provide
