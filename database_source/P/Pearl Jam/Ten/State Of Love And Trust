State of love and trust as I busted down the pretext
Sin still plays and a-preaches, but to half an empty court, uh-huh
And the signs are passin', grip the wheel, cannot read it
Sacrifice receiving the smell that's on my hands, hands, yeah

And I listen for the voice inside my head
Nothin', I'll do this one myself

Lay her down as priest does, should the Lord be a-countin'
Will be in my honor, make it pain-, painfully quick, uh-huh
Promises are whispered in the age of darkness
Want to be enlightened like I want to be told the end, yeah, yeah

And the barrel shakes aimed, oh, directly at my head
Oh, help me, help me from myself

And I listen from both sides of a friend
Oh, nothin', I'll do this one myself

And I listen for the voice inside my head
Oh, nothin', I'll do this one myself

And the barrel waits, trigger shakes, aimed right at my head
Oh, help me, help me from myself

State of love and a trust and a
State of love and a trust and a
State of love and a trust and a
State of love and
State of love and a trust and a
State of love and a trust and a
State of love and a trust and a
State of love and a trust
