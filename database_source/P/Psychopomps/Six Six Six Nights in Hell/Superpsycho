Here we are, the new breed
Here we are to stay
Here we are, superior
To the human race
We’re here to bring new meaning to your lives
We’re here to spread disorder in your minds
We’re here to change your world and for a start
We’ll tear it apart

Superpsycho!
Bring your new world!
Fuck up our minds any way you want to!

Burn — die — pigs

Come along and join us
Come along and enjoy
Come along you’ve got no choice
Help us destroy
We’re gonna end your total anarchy
We’re gonna bring back true authority
We’re gonna change your world and for a start
We’ll tear it apart

Yeah, you motherfucking fucks
I’m gonna waste ya
I’m gonna hunt you down
You’re gonna bleed, man
Bleed, bleed
Yeah, well you fucking creep
You’re gonna fucking die

Superpsycho!
Bring your new world!
Fuck up our minds any way you want to!

If you need persuasion
If you don’t believe
If you conspire against us
You’ll fucking bleed
You better take us serious
You better not resist
You better try and predict us
This ain’t no fucking game

Get ready for redemption
One promise we’ll keep
We’re gonna fucking kill you
Anytime we please
It’s time to die we’ll fucking bring you down
It’s time to burn we’ll burn you to the ground
It’s time to change your world and for a start
We’ll tear it apart

We’re here to bring new meaning to your lives
We’re here to spread disorder in your minds
We’re going to end your total anarchy
We’re going to bring back true authority
It’s time to die we’ll fucking bring you down
It’s time to burn we’ll burn you to the ground
It’s time to change this world and for a start
We’ll tear it all apart

Burn — die — pigs
Burn — die — pigs
