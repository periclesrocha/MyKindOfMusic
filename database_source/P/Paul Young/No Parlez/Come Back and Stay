Since you’ve been gone
I shut my eyes and I fantasize
That you’re here with me
Will you ever return?

I won’t be satisfied
’Till you’re by my side
Don’t wait any longer
Come back

(Why don’t you come back?)
(Please hurry)
(Why don’t you come back?)
(Please hurry)

Come back and stay for good this time
(Did you write the book of love?)
Come back and stay for good this time
(Ego, envy, lust)

You said goodbye
I was trying to hide what I felt inside until you passed me by

You said you’d return
You said that you’d be mine ’til the end of time

Well don’t wait any longer
(Why don’t you come back?)
(Please hurry)
(Why don’t you come back?)
(Please hurry)

Come back and stay for good this time
(Did you write the book of love?)
Come back and stay for good this time
(Ego, envy, lust)

Oh, since you’ve been gone
Opened my eyes and I realize what we had together

Will you ever return?
I’ll have you change your mind
If you won’t stay mine just love me forever
Love me forever

(Why don’t you come back?)
(Please hurry)
(Why don’t you come back?)
(Please hurry)
(Why don’t you come back?)
(Please hurry)
(Why don’t you come back?)
(Please hurry)

Just come back and stay for good this time
(Did you write the book of love?)
Come back and stay for good this time
(Ego, envy, lust)

Come back and stay for good this time
(Did you write the book of love?)
Come back and stay for good this time
(Ego, envy, lust)

Don’t ever leave

(Did you write the book of love?)

Hmmm

(Ego, envy, lust)

Oooh-ooo-oooh

(Did you write the book of love?)

What if, everything, everything we had together

(Ego, envy, lust)

(Did you write the book of love?)

(Ego, envy, lust)
