Domination is not the end
Surrender, surrender is
Domination is not the end
Surrender, surrender is

Domination is not the end
Surrender, surrender is

Domination is not the end
Surrender, surrender is
Domination is not the end
Surrender, surrender is

In the day, you wait
At night, you wear

Domination is not the end
Surrender, surrender is
Domination is not the end
Surrender, surrender is
