Clark

The first thing that I heard you say
When you were standing there
Set in your way was that you were not blind
You were sure to make a fool of me
Cause there was nothing there
That you could see
That could go beyond your mind
Now who's standing at the door
Remembering the days before
And asking please be kind
It isn't how it was set up to be
But I've set you free this time

I have never been so far out in front
That I could ever ask for what I want
And have it any time
Knowing this you found a thought for me
That told you just what I should be
And there I stood behind
With all the ones that went before
And memories that always seems to
Tear me from my mind
In front of what it is you seem me to be
I've set you free this time

I could never find a chance to choose
Between a way to win or a thing to lose
Because there was your stand
On top of all the love you took
There was only something
You can look at lying in your hand
Now who's wondering what has changed
And why it can not be arranged
To have each thing work fine
It isn't how it was set up to be
But I'll set you free this time
