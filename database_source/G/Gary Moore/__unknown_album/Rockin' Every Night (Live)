Let me tell you 'bout a place I know
The kind of place where the kids all go
Come along baby you can shake off your blues
Don't be shy, you've got nothin' to lose

We'll be rockin' every night
Rollin' till the break of day
Rockin' every night
Rollin' till the break of day
Yeah-yeah-yeah

Let me tell you 'bout a girl I met
She made it hard for me to forget
She said "Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies"
So I gave it to her straight between the eyes

We were rockin' every night
Rollin' till the break of day
Rockin' every night
Rollin' till the break of day
That's right, we were rockin'
Allright
You know what I mean

I don't care if they call the cops
I'm gonna keep on rockin' till the party stops
You can leave if there's too much noise
You know what they say
Boys will always be boys
That's right
You know what I mean
Aaah

Rockin' every night
Rollin' till the break of day
We were rockin' every night
Rollin' till the break of day
That's right, yeah
Hah

I don't care if the neighbours shout
I don't care if they kick me out
I'll come right back and knock down the door
Cause when I start to rock
You know I always want more
I always want more, just like my name says
Yeah, that's right
That's right

Keep on rockin', keep on rollin'
Keep on rockin', keep on rollin' every night
