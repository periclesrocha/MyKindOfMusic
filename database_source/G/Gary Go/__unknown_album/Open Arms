Whatever happened to truth
Lost without a trace
Whatever happened to the mirror
That showed me a happy face
Whatever happened to sorry
You know it's never too late
Whatever happened to good things coming
Coming to those who wait
Whatever happened to this city
It's not like it used to be
Whatever happened to me

Whatever happened to living
Without fear
Wathever happened to peace all over
Such a strong idea
Whatever happende to our future
Cause I can see it in the rear view
Wathever happened to me
Whatever happened to you

Gotta look myself in the eye
And say it's gonna be alright
Maybe everything won't be alright
All the time
I've gotta take these chances where they are
It's gonna be alright
I've gotta see things for what they are
At the time

Lost with no place to begin
I'll slowly adjust to the sun just face I'm in

Whatever happened to the list
of things I wanted to be
Whatever happened to you
Whatever happened to me

Gotta look myself in the eye
And say it's gonna be alright
Maybe everything won't be alright
All the time
I've gotta take these chances where they are
And it's gonna be alright
I've gotta see things for what they are
At the time, at the time

Yeah the words are on the seam
Ready to receive
I'm the ocean you're the stream
Ready to receive
It's like open arms to me
Ready to, ready to receive

Gotta look myself in the eye
And say it's gonna be alright
Maybe everything won't be alright
All the time
No, I've gotta take these chances where they are
And it's gonna be alright
I've gotta see things for what they are
At the time
I've gotta see things for what they are
At the time,
At the time
