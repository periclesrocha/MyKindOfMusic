I remember when I first laid eyes on you
My man Tom introduced us but I was too shy to say hi
When I finally built up enough nerve to drop a line
You made it clear you wasn't just another MySpace mistress

And I didn't take it personal
When you ignored my request to be your friend I spilled my guts and hit send
Waited 2 weeks for a response and got nothing
Honestly it only made me want you more

Week 4 rolled around and I was this close to letting go
But something wouldn't let me even though I hardly knew you
It was plain to see we were meant to lock lips
You knock me out with the brass knuckle tats on your hips

I was on this website late night lurking
When I got a message from you that was labeled urgent
You said you weren't impressed by lame dudes with no game
They're all the same tryin' to get your instant messenger name

But the fact that you hittin' me back made me smile
You must've saw somethin you liked when you was skimming through my profile
You caught me at the most pivotal moment
So now I'm emailing my love with a dozen digital roses

So click approve, so simple
Show me some kind of sign and let me know it's time to make my move
Just click approve, come on girl
Baby I'm one of a kind and I ain't got time to lose

Just click approve, you're killin' me here
Show me some kind of sign and let me know it's time to make my move
Just click approve, come on girl
Baby I'm one of a kind and I ain't got time to lose

Let's face it, it's a sad situation when we have to resort to keyboards as a means of making relations
But I don't have the patience, I get straight to the point
So this is me at my most honest
No egos, no Gym Class status, just Travis

Love it or leave it, but you gotta admit
On a scale of one to awesome I'm the shit
Just get over it, it happened god damn it, I've been waitin too long
Even wrote a song about, like to hear it, here it go
If I'm being too annoying, let me know (just let me know)

But it's hard for me to not hate when I'm on MySpace
I never see my face in your Top 8
Approaching 6 weeks now, it's kinda obvious that you're either occupied or playing a game
All my money's on the latter, this is not a LOL matter
Why would you pass up a chance this great?

If there were two forces and I split them down the middle, I could swing back and forth for 3 days
Rephrase
If I had two horses, and I beat them with authority, I'd gallop all the way to Canada to see your face
But all I got is this Powerbook and iChat

Besides I hit you all the time and you never write back
I stay on my feet
Shit
And be persistent 'til my name is under who you would like to meet

So click approve, so simple
Show me some kind of sign and let me know it's time to make my move
Just click approve, come on girl
Baby I'm one of a kind and I ain't got time to lose

Just click approve, you're killin' me here
Show me some kind of sign and let me know it's time to make my move
Just click approve, come on girl
Baby I'm one of a kind and I ain't got time to lose

Who cares if we don't know each other's last name
All I know is that I'm smitten with your pictures wishin' you would feel the same
I admit I get a little jealous when other dudes leave you comments
Don't let it gas you up, it's all nonsense

Lately I been romancing the thought of me and you speaking in tongues in this mansion I bought
But it's all wishful thinking
Just give me some kind of sign to let me know I'm not freakin' you out
And if you lovin' what I'm speaking about, then say something

I check my inbox ten times and ain't nothin'
You probably busy doing something sexy
I just hope I'm in your thoughts next time you log in
And if not, ain't no love lost between you and me
I'll be here when your man ain't fully down as he used to be
So yeah it's time to sign out, my vision's getting blurry
This is madness, XOXO dash Travis

So click approve, so simple
Show me some kind of sign and let me know it's time to make my move
Just click approve, come on girl
Baby I'm one of a kind and I ain't got time to lose

Just click approve, you're killin' me here
Show me some kind of sign and let me know it's time to make my move
Just click approve, come on girl
Baby I'm one of a kind and I ain't got time to lose
So click approve.
