When you arrived
It’s already over
Covered in a silver sheen
A refrain
Softer than spoken
Like a face on the magazine
Too lost forgotten

Smoke a soldier’s stolen cigarette
Prop chairs in your cardboard future
Softer than spoken
Listen to me

Can’t you see
TV repeat on the brain
Find another golden silhouette
Sweat on the velvet
Too lost forgotten

When you arrived
It’s already over
Whispered on the silver screen
A refrain
Softer than spoken
Like a face on the magazine
Too lost forgotten

Smoke a soldier’s stolen cigarette
Prop chairs in your cardboard future
Softer than spoken

Can’t you see
TV repeat on the brain
Find another golden silhouette

(When you arrived)

Too lost forgotten

(When you arrived)

Softer than spoken

(When you arrived)
