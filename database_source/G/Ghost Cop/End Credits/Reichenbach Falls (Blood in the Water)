Suicide
You never even wanted to die

Close your eyes
Hearing signs from the other side

It’s like it didn’t even happen
It’s like it didn’t even happen

You caught your fingers in the net
This wasn’t supposed to be romantic
I hide my lipstick scratch
It’s like it didn’t even happen

Breathe out
There’s blood in the water

Breathe out
There’s blood in the water

Breathe out
There’s blood in the water

Breathe out
There’s blood in the water
