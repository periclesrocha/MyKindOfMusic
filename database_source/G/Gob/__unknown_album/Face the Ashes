I've just erased it's been a while, I've got a world for sale
And now I walk away from it, it's better done secret
I never mouthed those words away, I wouldn't cause concern
Die in a crossfire runaway none of this exists
Someone is killing me

Turn him away, lay over there
His limb is red, I have all clear
Settle the wave I'm on my way
Dreaming of red, memories are worst

I feel abrasive worn and tired, don't think I could win
Take me to a place I adore and then seal me in
I'm not the one I swear I'm not, no matter how I felt
Die in a crossfire runaway, face the ash again
Someone is killing me
