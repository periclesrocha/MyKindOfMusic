Well tonight's the night
We've got to get this right
We are lifting up our love
To the Lamb of God
Make a righteous noise
Together as one voice
We'll let Him know that we are hear
To be a burning legacy of love to Him

Start the fire
Strike the match and heat up your heart
Start the fire
Let it burn until we make a mark
Start the fire
Let it turn into a raging flame
You'll see, you'll never be the same
Once you start the fire

Got to make this clear
He brought us hear
And you and I are bonded by
The mighty Son of God
So let the praise begin
Start by looking at Him
And bring Him all our energy
Use this night to let Him know how much we care

CHORUS

God is here
Waiting to move
We are here
To worship Him
