No life till leather
We're gonna kick some ass tonight
We got the metal madness
When our fans start screaming
It's right; well, all right, yeah
When we start to rock, we never
Want to stop again

Hit the lights

We know our fans are insane
We're gonna blow this place away
With volume higher
Than anything today; the only way
When we start to rock, we never
Want to stop again

Hit the lights

With all our screaming
We're gonna rip right through your brain
We got the lethal power
It's causing you sweet pain, oh, sweet pain
When we start to rock, we never
Want to stop again

Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit the lights
Hit them lights
