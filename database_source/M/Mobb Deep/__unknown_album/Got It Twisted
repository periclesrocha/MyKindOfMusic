put you in the trunk then dump dump the body
nigga you dont know you betta ask somebody
ya'll get down we gonna clash prob'ly
builty snowflake out of the ampacomby
i'm tryin to rip britney so i made ja sign me
nigga catch me in tha club with a double lead banger
im the wrong one to fuck with
now i know the promoters im in with the musket
pound of the haze and a box of dutches
high to the cotton mouth
paranoid make the wrong move bitch and your ass is out

if i can't get your head swing by your house (motherfucker)

Ya'll niggas got it twisted huh?

Ya'll niggas got it twisted huh?
that liquor up in your U-Charge (U-Charge)

a little blood get on my daughter, thats nothing she'll live (just whipe that off)
got cops shoot to death of us
we dont like D's
you never catch us runnin with the police (nope)
ya'll niggas get ya'll vests up

that turth come out when u drunk
your ass wont make it to see tomorrow
Ya'll niggas got it twisted huh?
