Grant us grace and grant us hope (2x)

When you bring this joy in our youth
In the age of want and despair
Ooooh, You're always leading
Ooooh, with the life You're bringing

And we wonder who we are
And we ponder who we've become
Ooooh, our hearts have slumbered
Ooooh, our feet have stumbled

Kyrie eleison, Christe eleison
Kyrie eleison, Christe eleison

(English:
God have mercy, Christ have mercy
God have mercy, Christ have mercy)

When we pass through ancient streets
Of our hopeless history
Ohhh, our eyes are weeping
Ohhh, but we are seeking

Kyrie eleison, Christe eleison
Kyrie eleison, Christe eleison
