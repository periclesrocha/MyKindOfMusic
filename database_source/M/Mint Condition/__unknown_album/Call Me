I overheard you and your girlfriend talking
Problems with your man's infidelity
The same thing happened to me and my lady
So I left you with my card anonymously

[Chorus:]
Call me, if you will, call me
Cause I know how you feel, call me
Fax me, baby here's my number
Eight two five four two sixty three, just call me

So you made up your mind to make this visit
Checkin' up on people is my business
You needed confirmation for suspicion
That left you crying over a thousand minutes
Now suddenly I feel the plot thickening
I find myself having to atone
This situation has my mind just spinning
Cause now I really want you for my own, my own

[Chorus x2]

Sassy scatting (go head Stokley!)

[Chorus: w/Adlib to end]
