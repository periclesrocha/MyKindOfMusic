I found new meaning since you
Said you were mine
The planet flipped its axis and I
Nearly spat out my mind
Don't take it away now baby
Don't take it away
I got new meaning baby
Don't take it away

I keep finding new meaning
Changing how I perceive
I can finally stand this place 'cause
You're in love with me
