[They live without hope]

Staring in the face of condemnation
Laughter fills the sky instead of rain

Live my life alone in resignation
Arms outstretched for those who cannot see

Scarecrow

Crucified and left in isolation
Pictures of our lost morality

Scarecrow
Scarecrow

[They live without hope]
[They live without hope]

Eyeless stares invite this whole damnation
Rotting corpse of inhumanity

Scarecrow
Scarecrow

[They live without hope]

[They live without hope]

[They live without hope]

[They live without hope]
