Haven’t you ever felt this way before?
(with a perfect stranger)
The look on her face, it just gives her away, she can’t take any more

Hoist up your white flag, call for a truce
Try separation, we both stand to lose
She looks in my eyes as we say our goodbyes and she says,
(say you’re sorry)
Say you’re sorry (tell me, tell me)
Say you’re sorry (right from the heart)
Say you’re sorry
Say you’re sorry

Think of the times when we couldn’t wait to get home
(from the arms of danger)
Funniest part was the danger was right in our being home

You hoist up your white flag, you seem so amused
Living in riddles without giving clues
Looks in your eyes as you say your goodbyes and she says,
(say you’re sorry)
Say you’re sorry (tell me, tell me)
Say you’re sorry (right from the heart)
Say you’re sorry
Say you’re sorry

We’ve had our problems and we’ve had our fights
I was the wrong one and you were the right
No more fighting, it ends tonight
It’s your turn to say you’re sorry
Say you’re sorry
Say you’re sorry (say you’re sorry)
Say you’re sorry
Say you’re sorry (say you’re sorry)
Say you’re sorry
Say you’re sorry
Say you’re sorry
Say you’re sorry
Say you’re sorry (say you’re sorry)
Say you’re sorry (say you’re sorry)
Say you’re sorry (say you’re sorry)
Say you’re sorry (say you’re sorry)
Say you’re sorry (say you’re sorry)
Say you’re sorry (say you’re sorry)
Say you’re sorry
