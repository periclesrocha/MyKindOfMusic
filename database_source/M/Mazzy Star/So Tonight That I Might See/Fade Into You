I wanna hold the hand inside you
I wanna take a breath that’s true
I look to you and I see nothing
I look to you to see the truth

You live your life, you go in shadows
You’ll come apart and you’ll go black
Some kinda night into your darkness
Colors yours eyes with what’s not there

Fade into you
Strange you never knew
Fade into you
I think it’s strange you never knew

A stranger’s light comes on slowly
A stranger’s heart without a home
You put your hands into your head
And then its smiles cover your heart

Fade into you
Strange you never knew
Fade into you
I think it’s strange you never knew

Fade into you
Strange you never knew
Fade into you
I think it’s strange you never knew

I think it’s strange you never knew
