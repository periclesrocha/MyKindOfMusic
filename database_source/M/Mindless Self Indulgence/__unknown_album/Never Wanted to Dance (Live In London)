There is nothing you can do that I have not already done to myself (x4)

I never wanted to dance with nobody but you
I never wanted to dance with nobody but you
I never wanted to dance with nobody but you
Wouldn’t take no for an answer, you fuckin’ bitch

Be nice
Be nice to me
And don’t let me be
Be nice
Be nice to me
And don’t let me go

I’m too cool for the second grade
I’m amazed
I’m afraid
I’m too cool for the second grade
There is nothing
You can do

That I have not already done to myself
