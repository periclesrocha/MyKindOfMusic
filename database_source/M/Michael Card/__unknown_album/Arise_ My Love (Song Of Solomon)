Arise, my love, my lovely one, come
The winter is past, and the rains are gone
The flowers appear, it's the season of song
My beautiful one, arise and come with me

Who is it that appears like the dawn?
As fair as the moon, as bright as the sun?
Show me your face, let me hear your voice
My beautiful one, arise and come with me

Set me like a seal on your heart
For love is unyielding as the grave
The flash of it is a jealous fire no flood can quench
For love is as strong as death

Arise, my love, and come with me
Before the dawn breaks and the shadows flee
You ravished my heart with just one glance
My beautiful one, arise and come with me

Set me like a seal on your heart
For love is unyielding as the grave
The flash of it is a jealous fire no flood can quench
For love is as strong as death

Do not arouse or awaken love until it so desires

Arise, my love, my lovely one, come
The winter is past and the rains are gone
The flowers appear, it's the season of song
My beautiful one, arise and come with me

I am my love's, my beloved is mine
Arise and come with me
