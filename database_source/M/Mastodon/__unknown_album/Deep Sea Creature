Knowing right, learning wrong
What you're feeling is pressure
Pulsate new blood

I've seen things you've heard never before
Bones aged in dust
Buy your bite, take the body

Calm, shutting down
You built me
I knew it

I'll never lie, liar
You fed me
I chewed it

I'll never lie, liar
I follow you, covering me
Spirits in pieces
Crumbled and burnt
