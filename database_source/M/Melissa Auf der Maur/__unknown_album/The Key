Everyone knows it
We all can feel it
There's one person out there
That leads you to freedom

It's time to find the key that leads you to me

Do you know?
Do you know?
Do you know what I've found? Do you want?
do you want?
do you want to share it?

The way
The way
To use it

Everyone knows it
We all can feel it
There's one person out there
That leads you to freedom
And it's time to find the key that leads you to me Your destiny

The key,
The key,
The key, it finds you
Be sure,
Be sure,
Be sure, to use it

It twists, it turns, it burns, it bruises

Everyone knows it
We all can feel it
There's one person out there
That leads you to freedom
And it's time to find the key that leads you to me

Everyone knows it
We all can feel it
There's one person out there
That leads you to freedom
And it's time to find the key that leads you to me
Your destiny...

Everyone knows it
We all can feel it
There's one person out there
That leads you to freedom
