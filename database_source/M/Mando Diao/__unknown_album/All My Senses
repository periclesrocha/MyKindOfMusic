Pull the trigger, break down in a love affair
When I said I didn't care, you started searching for tomorrow
Pull the trigger, my girl you're running all alone
I said I was back home, but I'm far away

And there ain't no point in the words I write
There ain't no way to know me
But it sure felt right when I saw your eyes
But now they feel like, oh yeah they feel like Mondays

And all my senses seem to shine through the day
Seem to shine through the day, honey that's okay
Yes all my senses seem to shine in the night
Seem to shine in the night, honey that's alright

In your heart girl, I see a jealous butterfly
You wanted me high, love, but I'm sober still
In your heart girl, there's nothing left but misery
Come dance while I'm getting free I'm gonna lie again

Cause there ain't no point in the words I write
There ain't no way to get me But I sure was high when I saw your smile
But now your always, oh yes you're always gone girl

And all my senses seem to shine through the day
Seem to shine through the day, honey that's okay
Yes all my senses seem to shine in the night
Seem to shine in the night, honey that's alright

All my senses seem to shine in the night
Seem to shine in the night, honey that's alright
And all my senses seem to be in this song
Thinking all day long, honey what went wrong
Tell me what went wrong
Tell me what went wrong
