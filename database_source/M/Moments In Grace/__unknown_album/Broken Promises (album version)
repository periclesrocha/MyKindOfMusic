So I've blown, I've blown it all on cures for pain,
And I've learned to regret the choices that, that I've made
I want, I want to stay awake for days
Until the sunlight washes over my face

Chorus: Forgive, forget all of our broken promises
Forgive, forget all of our broken promises
We run, run, run to loose it all

These days, are darker and they draw me in
And I left a trail but noone missed me in, in the end
I'll blend, I'll blend in with the shade I've been
But where, where do i begin, if i want to learn to

Chorus

I felt a chill in the air and you turned as I said your name
A glance turned to a stare and you hardly knew my face
A blank page, an empty safe, things will never be the same

Forgive, forget all of our broken promises
Forgive, forget all of our broken promises

Forgive, forget all of our broken promises
Forgive, forget all of our broken promises
We run, run, run, run
We run, run, run to loose it all
