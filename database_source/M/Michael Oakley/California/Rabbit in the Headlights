It’s gotta be me — there’s no way
Someone else could feel this way I feel about you
And we’re free
To be what we want and touch the sky together
Before you came around I was drowning in the depths of despair
And then when you finally came
It’s funny you were unaware…

That when you look in my eyes I’m a rabbit in the headlights
And when you’re touchin’ my skin I’m a river in the moonlight
It’s got to be the right time, the right place, the right kind of moment
It’s got to be the right kind of feeling and deeper emotion

I’m holding back, insecurity
Taking me two steps forward and one step back from you
I’m afraid If I try to reach too soon that you might back away
How can I try to hide a feeling that’s so wonderful?
How do I tell you that you’re the fire burning in my soul?

’Cause when you look in my eyes I’m a rabbit in the headlights
And when you’re touchin’ my skin I’m a river in the moonlight
It’s got to be the right time, the right place, the right kind of moment
It’s got to be the right kind of feeling and deeper emotion

’Cause when you look in my eyes I’m a rabbit in the headlights
And baby when you’re touchin’ my skin I’m a river in the moonlight
It’s got to be the right time, the right place, the right kind of moment
It’s got to be the right kind of feeling and deeper emotion
