Walk away!

Look out now, baby won’t you take me away,
Sittin’ here its gonna be a new day.
Gotta sing my song and I can’t go wrong,
Gotta keep on roaming, gotta sing my song.

What you feeling when you hold me tight?
I’m gonna cuddle up with you tonight, gonna get you feeling so secure.
Listen child don’t you see there’s a cure?
Anywhere got to get you away, feels so good think it’s gonna be a new day.
I’m gonna get my song till I can’t go on,
I’m gonna keep on roaming gonna sing my song.

What you feeling when you hold me tight?
I’m gonna cuddle up with you tonight, gonna get you feeling so secure.
Listen child don’t you see there’s a cure? Ooh Yeah!
Anywhere got to get you away, feels so good think it’s gonna be a new day.
I’m gonna get my song till I can’t go on,
I’m gonna keep on roaming gonna sing my song.

Gonna sing my song yeah,
And it won’t take long.
Gonna sing my song yeah,
Won’t you sing along.

I want you to sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it along.
I want you to sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it along.
I want you to sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it along.
I want you to sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it along.

Cause I’m a drifter
Drifting on
