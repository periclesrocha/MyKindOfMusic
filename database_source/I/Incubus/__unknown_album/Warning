Bat your eyes girl
Be otherworldly
Count your blessings
Seduce a stranger

What's so wrong with
Being happy?
Kudos to those who
See through sickness, yeah

Over and over and over and over
And ooh

She woke in the morning
She knew that her life had passed her by
And she called out a warning
"Don't ever let life pass you by."

I suggest we learn to love
Ourselves before it's made illegal
When will we learn?
When will we change?
Just in time to see it all come down

Those left standing will make millions
Writing books on the way it should have been

She woke in the morning
She knew that her life had passed her by
And she called out a warning
"Don't ever let life pass you by."

Floating in this
Cosmic Jacuzzi
We are like
Frogs oblivious

To the water
Starting to boil
No one flinches
We all float face down

She woke in the morning
She knew that her life had passed her by
And she called out a warning
"Don't ever let life pass you by."
Pass you by

Ohh, ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh, ohh
