Been waiting for an end in a life filled with all those little stories
(Say what you want, say what you need)
Our last encounter...
(Say what you want, say what you need)
Stung of alcohol...
And all the stones and prison bars that stand in the way of my amends

Forgive me!

I know you killed for me... you're sailing with the rock, Aileen
Promise you'll come for me, the sixth of June will bring you home
Say what you want, say what you need
Because tonight is your last chance to reach me

Hope and love seem to...
(Say what you want, say what you need)
Be a waste in this mortal reality

So we'll meet again on the sixth of June
There won't be a heart to break this time
And all the souls of fallen men can't stand in the way of our love again

Forgive me!

I know you killed for me... you're sailing with the rock, Aileen
Promise you'll come for me, the sixth of June will bring you home
Say what you want, say what you need
Because tonight is your last chance to reach me

I know you killed for me... you're sailing with the rock, Aileen
Promise you'll be back on the sixth of June, our Lord will guide you home
Say what you want, say what you need
Because tonight is your last chance to reach me

I know you killed for me... you're sailing with the rock, Aileen
Promise you'll come for me, the sixth of June will bring you home
Say what you want, say what you need
(I know you killed for me, I know you killed for me)
Say what you want, say what you need
(I know you killed for me, say what you need)
Because tonight is your last chance to reach me
