I’m standing here on the ground
The sky above won’t fall down
See no evil in all directions
Resolution of happiness
Things have been dark for too long

Don’t change for you
Don’t change a thing, for me

Don’t change for you
Don’t change a thing, for me

I found a love I had lost
It was gone for too long
Hear no evil in all directions
Execution of bitterness
Message received loud and clear

Don’t change for you
Don’t change a thing, for me

Don’t change for you
Don’t change a thing, for me

I’m standing here on the ground
The sky above won’t fall down
See no evil in all directions
Resolution of happiness
Things have been dark for too long

Don’t change for you
Don’t change a thing, for me

Don’t change for you
Don’t change a thing, for me

Don’t change for you
Don’t change a thing, for me
