What is the name to call
For a different kind of girl
Who knows the feelings
But never the words

To look at you
And never speak
Is so good
For me tonight

To look at you
And never speak
Is so good
For me tonight

What is the name to call
For a different kind of girl
Who knows the feelings
But never the words

Who do you ask when there’s no one
Left to turn to
You ask me and I’ll always try to hear
Past money and colors and make believe
Good cheap values for a thrifty clown

To look at you
And never speak
Is so good
For me tonight

To look at you
And never speak
Is so good
For me tonight

To look at you
And never speak
Is so good
For me tonight

What is the name to call
For a different kind of girl
Who knows the feelings
But never the words

What do you fear in the simple
Still of a summer’s night?
I understand I sympathize for a day dream
Fairytailes and I love you

What is the name to call
For a different kind of girl
Who knows the feelings
But never the words
To this, real life documentary
