Conclusions, illusions, of mainstream intrusions
I'm saying this is just your life
Brain of the main-frame, life
Your single one and only life
I'm starting from the back again, it's never ending
Ran off the track yes once again, the vibe is sending
So far from where I might have been, this message pending
I won't stop looking back again, the road is bending
Time exists on a band 'round your wrist, and the people you trust should be last on your list


We could solve the world's problems with just one wish, we were made like this
Time exists on a band 'round your wrist, and the people you trust should be last on your list
We could solve the world's problems with just one wish, we were made like this
Made like this, made like this
I'm saying this is just your life
(Chorus)
This is just your life, I'm saying this is just your life
