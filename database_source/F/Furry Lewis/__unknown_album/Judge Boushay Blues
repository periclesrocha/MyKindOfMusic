Good mornin' judge, what may be my fine?
Good mornin' judge, what may be my fine?
Good mornin' judge, what may be my fine?
Fifty dollars eleven twenty-nine

They arrest me for murder and I ain't never harmed a man
Arrest me for murder and I ain't never harmed a man
Arrest me for forgery and I can't even sign my name

Arrest me for murder and I ain't hurt a man
Arrest me for murder and I ain't harmed a man
Arrest Furry for forgery and he can't even sign his name

Some got six months, some got a solid year
Some got six months, some got a solid year
But me and my partner, we got lifetime here

If I just had-a known, goin' to get so long
If I just had-a known, I was goin' to get so long
Boy if I had-a known, I was goin' to get so long
Some Western country would have been my home

Western country would have been my home
Western country would have been my home

I know my baby, she don't know I'm here
I know my baby, she don't know I'm here
Boy that baby, she don't know I'm here
If she do, she sure don't feel my care
