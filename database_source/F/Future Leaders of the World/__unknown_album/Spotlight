Tell you mother to have her vision examined
Tell your practitioner to practice famine
Children wearing suits hold briefcase family feuds
In juke box radio tunes
Coming to a store near you

We're gonna pull you in
Never gonna let you out
Make sure you know your way in a crowd
When freedom only costs as much as you can buy
They'll sell you whole life in pieces, rest till you die

So buy a life and sell a teen prophecy
Glam horror mock silver-screen guillotine
Put the whole family on trial tonight
Turn the television off and turn on the lights
With me...

We're gonna pull you in
Never gonna let you out
Make sure you know your way in a crowd
When freedom only costs as much as you can buy
They'll sell you whole life in pieces, rest till you die

We're gonna pull you in
Never gonna let you out
Make sure you know your way in a crowd
When freedom only costs as much as you can buy
They'll sell you whole life in pieces, rest till you die

Billboards advertise magazines
Record our memories rape our dreams
In Hollywood faces burnt like dollars bills
Why should I trade my drugs for your pills, Mr. Capital Hill?
Sell me war, you're a king now
Get up in the spotlight...

Get up in the spotlight

We're gonna pull you in
Never gonna let you out
Make sure you know your way in a crowd
When freedom only costs as much as you can buy
They'll sell you whole life in pieces, rest till you die

We're gonna pull you in
Never gonna let you out
Make sure you know your way in a crowd
When freedom only costs as much as you can buy
They'll sell you whole life in pieces, rest till you die

Get up get up were in the spotlight
Get up get up were in the spotlight
Spotlight spotlight crowd
Spotlight spotlight crowd
We're in the spotlight now......
