Under the spotlight
I feel our world becoming one
Around me I feel
Everything we are everything we see
I'll take a part of you
You take a part of me

Knowing at a glance
Where we all stand
Searching for another chance
To make us all one

Above the staring eyes
I sense that we are one
Knowing, showing
Everything we are everything we see
I'll take a part of you
You take a part of me

Knowing at a glance
Where we all stand
Searching for another chance
To make us all one

After the fading lights
I felt that we were one
I know I need
Everything we are everything we see
I took a part of you
You took a part of me

Knowing at a glance
Where we all stand
Searching for another chance
To make us all one
