I'm lying broken under jagged pieces
Of burned out bridges
Suffocating I can't breathe
No direction
I'm scattered in the breeze
Living on memories

Everywhere I look
As far as I can see
Broken promises, broken promises
Pieces of me...

I'm drowning, choking
Falling deeper into this
Black hole we call living
And I can't breathe
No connection
I scattered in the breeze
Living on memories

Everywhere I look
As far as I can see
Broken promises, broken promises
Pieces of me...

All that I remember now
Are people and shadows

Everywhere I look
As far as I can see
Broken promises, broken promises
Pieces of me...
