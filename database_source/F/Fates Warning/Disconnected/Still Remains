I had so much to say
But no words to speak
The feelings were strong
But I was only weak

So there we were again
Tragic and absurd
Choking on every line
And every final word

A few pages from an old diary
A dusty shelf, an unread history
All these words and memories
Are all of you that's really left for me

And a fading memory
Can't cloud the pain
When the voice is gone
The words still remains

And the years that fall away
Can't stop the rains
When illusion's gone
The truth still remains

A few lines from life's long soliloquy
A dying voice in one part harmony
All these words and memories
Are all of you that's really left for me

And a fading memory
Can't cloud the pain
When the voice is gone
The words still remains

And the years that fall away
Can't stop the rains
When illusion's gone
The truth still remains

A final moment of clarity
A touch, a look, a last apology
All these words and memories
Are all of you that's left for me

And a fading memory
Can't cloud the pain
When the voice is gone
The words still remains

And the years that fall away
Can't stop the rains
When illusion's gone
The truth still remains

Where is the way
Where is direction
The ever open arms
Of over protection
Where is the hope
Where is laughter
The wild winter dreams
Of happy ever after

Deep in the night
Underneath the darkest skies
Searching for some sign or some distant light
Screaming yet unheard
Repeating every line
And every final word

They remain, they remain
You still remain
All these words and memories
And everything you were to me
They remain, they remain
You still remain

And here I am again
Tragic and absurd
Repeating every line
And every final word
