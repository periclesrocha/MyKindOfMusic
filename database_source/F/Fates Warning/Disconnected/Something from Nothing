Some things burden me
These thoughts cut deep
Sometimes I feel
Sometimes I see

I won't close my eyes
I won't look away
We've chased our dreams
We've had our way

Stood here so long
I've forgotten what I was even looking for
Nothing changes
It's all the same if nothing changes, changes

I thought I never needed
Everything I knew was wrong
I never thought I needed so much
I thought I never needed
Everything I knew was wrong
I never thought I needed more

Standing alone
I see what I was looking for, for so long
It's not where I am
It's everywhere I've been and where I'm going

I thought I never needed
Everything I knew was wrong
I never thought I needed so much
I thought I never needed
Everything I knew was wrong
I never thought I needed more

Take... take from nothing
Take... take from everything
Take... take from nothing
Make it, make it, make it something
So it's more, so much more than I need
So much more, so much more

I thought I never needed
Everything I knew was wrong
I never thought I needed so much
I thought I never needed
Everything I knew was wrong
I never thought I needed more
