So, I lost my head a while ago
But you seem to have done no better

We, we set fire in the snow
It ain't over, I'm not done

Some do magic
Some do harm
I'm holding on, holding on
I'm holding on to a straw

Who is the Alpha
And what is made of cloth
How do you say you're sorry and there's nothing
to be afraid of?

Is it dark already
How light is a light
Do you laugh while screaming
Is it cold outside?

One thing I know for certain
Oh I'm pretty sure
It ain't over
I'm not done
