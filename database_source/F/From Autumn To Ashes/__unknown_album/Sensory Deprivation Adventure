On your honor let me explain my behavior
On your honor I swear I was trying to savor
Who's the liar, Who's the killer?
You know I was doing a favor
When I fell upon her by way of a merciful murder

With every warning you wonder
Don't have to tell the truth
Just keep remaining mute
And I'll still think for my owner
Yes I know what I've done, and what I'm going to do

No weakness, no weak miss
Don't buckle under the pressure
A servant, a serf saint
For all those who suffer
Were caught in a current
Of confusion
But what's been suggested
And what has been proven

With every warning you wonder
Don't have to tell the truth
Just keep remaining mute
And I'll still think for my owner
Yes I know what I've done, and what I'm going to do

I am only what you made me
Now I am a reflection of your wealth
And if you think, you think you hate me now
You only hate yourself.

With every warning you wonder
Don't have to tell the truth
Just keep remaining mute
And I'll still think for my owner
Yes I know what I've done, and what I'm going to do
