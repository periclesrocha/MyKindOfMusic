You were once with me
But you decided to turn
Now my jealousy
Is a fire that burns
To the core of me
When will I ever learn

I could walk away
But that wouldn't be like me
I could turn my face
But then I couldn't see
You coming back to me
I'm waiting for that day

I've got a great big problem
You can't ever get to the bottom of
My love, no matter what you do
I can't let you go
I've got a great big problem
You can't ever get to the bottom of
My love
I can't let you go

You refuse to be
The one I meant for you to be
If you could only see
How this is killing me
You'd come back to me
I would set you free

I call your name
But it's always the same
You walk away
It's always the same
