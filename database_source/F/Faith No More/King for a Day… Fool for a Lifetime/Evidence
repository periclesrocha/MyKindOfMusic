If you want to open the hole
Just put your head down and go
Step beside the piece of the circumstance
Got to wash away the taste of evidence
Wash it away

(Evidence)
(Evidence)
(Evidence)
(Got a taste of evidence)

I didn’t feel a thing
It didn’t mean a thing
Look in the eye and testify:
I didn’t feel a thing

Anything you say, we know you’re guilty
Hands above your head, you won’t even feel me
You won’t feel me

Didn’t feel a thing…

I didn’t feel a thing
It didn’t mean a thing
Look in the eye and testify:
I didn’t feel a thing

(Evidence)
(Evidence)
(Evidence)
(Got a taste of evidence)

I didn’t feel a thing
It didn’t mean a thing
Look in the eye and testify:
I didn’t feel a thing

I didn’t feel a thing
It didn’t mean a thing
Look in the eye and testify:
I didn’t feel a thing
