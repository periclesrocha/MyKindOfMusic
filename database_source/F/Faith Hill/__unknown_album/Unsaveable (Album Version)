Love, so cruel
Yeah that's all that I got from you
Tell me what in the world could I do?
But leave
After all that you've done to me
Now it's so easy to say I'm over you

Cause baby I cried
A little too hard, a little too long
What I thought was right
Was way too wrong and too far gone
I can't bring back the love
There just aint enough
Available, impossible, unsaveable

Here you come
Tryin' to make up for what you've done
It's too late to say you're sorry now
Now it's your turn
Oh you can't cross that bridge you burned
You're on your own
When will you learn?

There's someone out there for me
Who thinks I'm beautiful
I've got to go

Cause baby I cried
A little too hard, a little too long
What I thought was right
Was way too wrong and too far gone
I can't bring back the love
There just aint enough
Available, impossible, unsaveable
