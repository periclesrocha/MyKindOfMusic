At the bar when this six foot starrr came walking my way
He said shorty your looking kinda bored, do you mind if i stay
My best friend said you gotaa talk
Cause i think he plays for atlanta hawks
I cant play,maybe someday
But right now im ok

[Hook:]
I gotta man i gotta man
I gotta man and he may not be a baller but hes so good to me
Hes around pick up everytime i call him
And he makes me so happy....so happy

See theres this guy from ney york that i
Know wanna be with me
Got it all, plenty ends plenty friends from a house in miami
Takes lots of trips wanting me to go
But then one day i had to let him go
But then one day i had to let him no
It sounds good and thats a real sweet
But my mans all i need

[Hook:]
I gotta man i gotta man
I gotta man and he may not be a baller but hes so good to me
Hes around pick up everytime i call him
And he makes me so happy...so happy

[Bridge:]
He's all that i need all i want
He's perfect for me that whats up
Cant nobody do it betterr
No worries,and im happy
