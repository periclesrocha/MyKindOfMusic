Did you get my message
The one I left while I was trying to condense everything that I meant
In a minute or less when I called to confess and make all of my stresses go bye-bye

Did you get my message
Didn't, I guess, 'cause if you did you would have called me with your sweet intent
And we could give it a rest instead of beating our breast, making all of the pressure go sky-high

Do you ever wonder what happens to the words that we send
Do they bend, do they break from the flight that they take
And come back together again with a whole new meaning
In a brand new sense, completely unrelated to the one I sent

Did you get my message, ooh
Did you get my message
Did you get my message, yeah, ooh

Uh oh, where did it go
Must have bypassed your phone and flown right outta the window
Oh well, how can I tell
Should I call the operator
Maybe she know the info
But whether or not if my message you got was too much or a lot to reply
Why not try this for a fact
Should you ever come back
I'd relax and be relieved of all my panic attacks

Ahh oooh
Did you get my message, ooh
Did you get my message, (Did you now?)
Did you get my message, yeah, ooh

Did you get my message, the one that I left
While I was trying to condense everything that I meant
Now the moment is passed
Not much sand in the glass and I'm standing to lose my mind

Do you ever wonder what happens to the words that we send
Do they bend, do they break from the flight that they take
And come back together again with a whole new meaning
To the matter of our love's defense, and please be sympathetic to the time I spent

Did you get my message, ooh
Did you get my message, (Did you now?)
Did you get my message, yeah, ooh

Did you get my message
No, I didn't hear a word
Did you get my message
Now I'm not gonna believe your lies anymore
Answer the question
I don't hear a thing from you and you keep saying you're coming
Did you get my message now that I wanna get back with you
Did you get my message, love that I wanna reconnect with you
Did you get my message, sugar now
I did not hear one thing you sent to me
Did you get my message, love
Answer the phone
