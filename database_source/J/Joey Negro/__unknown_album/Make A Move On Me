Come on make a move on me

Come on make a move on me

Come on make a move on me

Come on make a move on me now boy

I've been watching you watching me

What you gonna do?

Let's stop playing these silly games

Do what you gonna do

Oh you gotta

Feel me, heal me chase me chase me

Move me sooth me tease me

Leave me, trim me, grim me

Grill me feel me take me make me

Leave me leave me

Come on make a move on me

Make a move on me

Come on make a move on me

Come on make a move on me

Oh make a move on me

Come on make a move on me now boy

Come on make a move on me

Oh baby

Oh make a move on me

Make a move on me

Come on make a move on me

Make a move on me

Come on make a move

Come on make a move

Come on make a move

Come on make a move

I promise you I wont bite

Unless you want me to

(Unless you want me to baby)

I'll make love to you all through the night

If you want me to

(Ah do you need it?)

Come on and feel me, heel me chase me chase me

Move me sooth me tease me

Leave me, trim me, grim me

Grill me feel me take me make me

Leave me leave me

Come on make a move on me

Come on make a move on me

Baby make a move on me

Come on make a move on me

Come on make a move on me now boy

Right now right now

Come on make a move

Come make a move on me

Come on make a move

Come make a move on me

Come on make a move
