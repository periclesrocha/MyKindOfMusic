I used to look for you out in the daylight
I took highways and side streets and back lanes
Slept under open skies
And life can be cruel
But life can be sweet if I want it to be

The town that I once called home
I just can't hold on to
It's got strip malls and bus stops and people
I would never really talk to
And she says life could be sweet
But life is so cruel 'cause I let it be

And everybody out here
They wanna live somewhere else
I wish I could find a place
And stay there by myself
And bit by bit I swear I think I'm losing
All this city's confidence

And everybody out here
They wanna live somewhere else
And I wish I could find a place
And stay there by myself
And bit by bit
I swear I think I'm losing all this city's confidence
I swear I've lost
All this city's confidence
