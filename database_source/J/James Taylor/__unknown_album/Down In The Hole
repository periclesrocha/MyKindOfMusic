Watch your head on that root
Got to let your eyes adjust
I'm sorry about your suit
Can't do nothing about the dust
Welcome down underground
Hunker down a spell
Gets to feel like home to me
Though I know it looks like hell

Down in the hole
Lord, it's deep and the sides are steep
And the nights are long and cold
Down in the hole
Light and love and the world above
Mean nothing to the mole
(Don't mean nothing to the mole)

Never gets real hot down here
Fifty five degrees
It's always a little bit damp, I fear
But I've never seem to freeze
Mushrooms and earthworms
Fancy stuff to eat
A world of quiet contemplation (Oh, yes)
Just below the street

Down in the hole
Lord, it's deep and the sides are steep
And the nights are long and cold
Down in the hole
Light and love and the world above
Mean nothing to the mole

I'm in a hole
Since I lost my baby
Living in a hole
Since I lost my girl

Would you play in the moonlight
Would you dance in the dirt
Come home way past daybreak
Cockleburs all stuck in your shirt
Come back home to twilight
Come back home to me
Subterranean river you are
Meets the molten sea

Down in the hole
Lord, it's deep and the sides are steep
And the nights are long and cold
Down in the hole
Light and love and the world above
They show nothing to the mole

Down in the hole
Light and love and the world above
Got nothin' for the mole
Ain't got nothin'
For the mole

Look out for that
Look out for that
Look out for that root
Look out for that root

Welcome down underground
Welcome
