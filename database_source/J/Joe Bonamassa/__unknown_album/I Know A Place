I know a place, where the dogs ain't right
I know a place, where the sun don't shine
I know a place, where the girls do the talking
In the back of my mind, in the back of my mind

I know a place, little girl in your closet
But running high, got a knife in his hand
Nobody would say those things to his mama
So he opened that blade
And he cut that man
So he opened that blade
And he cut that man

I know a place,and it goes no further
And where you are, when you leave it behind
One piece of advice from one tom to another
Get out of your mind, get out of your mind
Get out of your mind, yeah

I know a place, I know a place
