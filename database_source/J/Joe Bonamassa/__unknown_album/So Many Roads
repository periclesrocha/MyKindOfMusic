So many roads
So many trains to ride
So many roads
So many trains to ride
I've got to find my baby
Before I can be satisfied

I was staring out my window
When I heard that whistle blow
I was staring out my window
When I heard that whistle blow
I thought it was a street light
Ohh... When I saw it glow


It was a mean old fireman
And a cruel engineer
It was a mean old fireman
And a cruel engineer
Yes, That took my baby
And left me standing here

So many roads
So many trains to ride
So many roads
So many trains to ride
I've got to find my baby
Before I'm satisfied
