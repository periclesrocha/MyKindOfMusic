Softly and tenderly, Jesus is calling
Calling for you and for me
See on the portals He's waiting and watching
Watching for you and for me

Come home, come home
Ye who are weary, come home
Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling
Calling, oh sinner, come home

Oh for the wonderful love He has promised
Promised for you and for me
Though we have sinned, He has mercy and pardon
Pardon for you and for me

Come home, come home
Ye who are weary, come home
Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling
Calling, oh sinner, come home

Calling, oh sinner, come home
