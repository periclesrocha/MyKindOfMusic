Watchin' every motion
In this foolish lovers game
On this endless ocean
Finally lovers know no shame
Turnin' and returnin'
To some secret place inside
Watchin' in slow motion
As you turn around and say
My love

Take my breath away
Take my breath away

Watchin' I keep waiting
Still anticipatin' love
Never hesitatin'
To become the fated ones
Turnin' and returnin'
To some secret place inside
Watchin' in slow motion
As you turn around and say
My love

Take my breath away
Take my breath away

Through the hourglass I saw you
In time you slipped away
When the mirror crashed I called you
And turned to hear you say
If only for today
I am unafraid

Take my breath away
You take my breath away
You take my breath
You take my breath
You take my breath
Away
You take my breath away (repeat til' fade)
