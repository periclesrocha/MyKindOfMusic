We caught each other by the body
And fell in a heap
Your doll in the dark bedroom woke
With her scream a whip
With her scream a whip

With your arms around my neck
We run through the thorny wood
The doll screamed after us to the world
Daddy was no good
Daddy was no good

You sobbed against my chest
I waded the riverâ€™s freeze
The doll had put your mummy on show
The kraken of the seas
As you lay on the bed
I lean to the locked door
The doll sat on the roof and screamed
I was with a whore
I was with a whore

The doll broke in that night
Killed you and was gone
Screaming at the stars to look
And see justice done
And see justice done
And see justice done.
