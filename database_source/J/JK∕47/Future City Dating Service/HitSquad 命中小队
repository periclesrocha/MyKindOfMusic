She pulls her head away to expose his shyness.
His eyebrows arch involuntarily and his mouth is blushed and eyes dilated.
He’s seeking a moment where he can see himself in her eyes and experience all the lovely experiences she reserves just for him.
She raises her lovely soft hands to his face and runs the thumb over his cheek bones, down his scruffy beard and across his full wet lips.
His script says, “I love you”. But he dare not recite dialogue.
No matter how long it’s been rehearsed — his eyes become misty, just as the rain began.
