Two bodies are tangled up tonight amongst themselves in a foggy parking lot
Hidden beneath the spot of an illuminated lamp post.
The electricity between them buzzes with each second/ Sparking into another miniature minute.
His fingers disappeared into the summer highlights of her hair/ and her hands vibrating against the small of his back.
Their shared heat cools the air as passion secretly instigates the slow dance into slower palpable rituals.
