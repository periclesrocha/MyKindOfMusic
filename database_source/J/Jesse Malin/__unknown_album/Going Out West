There’s a girl smoking cigarettes
She looks like you, looks like you
There’s a feeling I can’t forget
Coming through
Baby blue

Well they tore another building down
It’s nothing new
This town is through

There’s a feeling I get when I talk to you mama
So we’re going out west where the winds won’t harm us now
And the car is in the lane
We’ll never be the same

The stores are setting up for Halloween
Back at school the kids are cool
Painted ponies in this one horse town
Are getting old
I’ve been bought and sold

There’s a feeling I get when I talk to you mama
So we’re going out west where the winter winds won’t harm us now
There’s a feeling I get when I walk with you baby
So I hang around till the fall and I’ll be there
When you call
