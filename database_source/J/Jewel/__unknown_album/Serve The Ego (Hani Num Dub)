Mirror, mirror
Do you like what you see?
I'll dance for you
And you'll dance for me

Who says a woman cannot serve?
It would be my pleasure
Who says it is not my destiny
To let you control me

CHORUS
Underneath the disco light
Everybody's feeling alright
Get on your hands and knees
And praise the new deity
Serve the ego, serve the ego

Two ships sailing on a neon sea
Eat the flesh, spit out the seeds
Feathered hair and lam?(pronounced la-may)heels
What turns me on is so surreal

CHORUS

Tutt tutt
To discover
Oh no
Yesterday's lover
