I'm leavin' here runnin', my time has just run out
You see me runnin' now, my time has just run out
You never wanted me baby, Lord, I come to find out

I tried so hard, baby but I couldn't see past the doubt
Well, I tried so hard, baby, ooh, my time has run out
I been a fool so long, Lord, I come to find out

The wind is howlin', blues turnin' inside out
Oh, the wind is howlin', blues turnin' inside out
And my world is unravelin', boy, I come to find out

And I'm goin' up country where I'm barely known
Baby, I'm goin' up country where I'm barely known
I been with you, baby, made me lose my happy home

I said night is fallin' but I don't know where I'm goin'
I said night is fallin', ooh Lord, I don't know where I'm goin'
Only sight I'm seein' is the long old lonesome road

I gave you my lovin', you know what I'm talkin' bout
I gave you my lovin', you know what I'm talkin' bout
But you played me for a fool, baby, I come to find out
