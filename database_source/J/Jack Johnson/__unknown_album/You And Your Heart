Watch you when you say
What you are and when you blame
Everyone, you broken king
Watch you change the frame or
Watch you when you take your aim
At the sum of everything

'Cause you and your heart
Shouldn't feel so far apart
You can choose what you take
Why you gotta break and make it feel so hard

You lay there in the street
Like broken glass reflecting pieces of the sun
But you're not the flame
You got the people passing by
Because you know what you don't like
It's just so easy, it's just so easy

But you and your heart
Shouldn't feel so far apart
You can choose what you take
Why you gotta break and make it feel so hard

Oh and you and your heart
Shouldn't feel so far apart
You can choose what you take
Why you gotta break and make it feel so hard

You draw so many lines in the sand
Lost the fingernails on your hands
How you're gonna scratch any backs?
Better hope that time will take our lines away
Take all our lines and

Hope that time will take our lines and
Hope that time will take our lines away
Take all our lines away
