Ladies and gentlemen, get off the dance floor and start doing your chores, it’s Sunday afternoon!

It’s Sunday afternoon and there a few things that I have to do.
And I’m gonna do ’em, I’m gonna do ’em
It’s Sunday afternoon and there a few things that I have to do.
And I’m gonna do ’em, I’m gonna do ’em

First up, I gotta tidy up,
my place is getting messy
haven’t cleaned it in a month
I may be having friends over tomorrow night,
It’s not confirmed but just in case
I’d like my place to look nice.

Then I’ll go out to the grocery store
to get some more dish soap
I ran out a week ago
and I’ve been mixing it with water
just to make it last a little longer,
but now there’s really nothing left.

Then I’ll stop by at my parents’ to say hi
and maybe have a cup of coffee and a piece of pie.
And I’ll ask them how their week was…
“How was your week?”
And they’ll tell me how their week was…
“Pretty good.”

It’s Sunday afternoon and there a few things that I have to do.
And I’m gonna do ’em, I’m gonna do ’em
It’s Sunday afternoon and there a few things that I have to do.
And I’m gonna do ’em, I’m gonna do ’em

Then I’ll head down to the mall
pick up some black socks.
I don’t really need them
but I heard that they were half off.
You can never have too many socks you know,
so that you can always throw away the ones with holes.

Next up, take my dog out for a walk,
he needs the exercise and at the same time I talk
to the other people walking their dogs…
“Hello”
I usually ask them questions about their dogs,
“How old is he?”

Then I have to return this DVD of pornography
that my friend rented
I swear to God that it wasn’t me…
“It’s not mine, I swear.”

Alright fine, but it was the first time
I am not the kind of guy
that watches porn all the time…
Alright fine, I watch porn all the time.

It was Sunday afternoon and there were a few things that I had to do.
And I did ’em, and I did ’em
It was Sunday afternoon and there were a few things that I had to do.
And I did ’em, yes I did ’em

I only have one thing left to do,
and I’m not gonna do it in front of you.
So I’m gonna end the song like this,
as I warm up my wrist…

“Dammit, I forgot to buy kleenex.”

“Fuck…”

“Coming!”

“You want some of this, bitch?”
