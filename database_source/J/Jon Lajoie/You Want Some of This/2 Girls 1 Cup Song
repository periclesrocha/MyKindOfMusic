How do you show someone you love
That they are the one?
So many ways to express love
It’s hard to choose just one

How are you gonna do it?

Some people like to kiss, some people like to hug
Some lesbians like eating each other’s shit out of a cup
Some people say “I love you”, some even shout it out
Some people puke semi-digested shit into each other’s mouth

Sometimes making love is not enough
You have to step it up
And urinating on her face
Is not enough to say “I love you”

Some people like to kiss, some people like to hug
Some lesbians like eating each other’s shit out of a cup
Some people say “I love you”, some even shout it out
Some people puke semi-digested shit into each other’s mouth

She’s covered in vomit and human fecies
That’s how I know that she needs me

She’s covered in vomit and human fecies
That’s how I know that she needs me

She’s covered in vomit and human fecies
That’s how I know that she needs me

Shit in my mouth
And I puke it all over your face

I love you
