Ooh, baby
Anytime my world gets crazy
All I have to do to calm it
Is just think of you

'Cause when I think of you, baby
Nothin' else seems to matter
'Cause when I think of you, baby
All I think about is our love

I just get
More attached to you when
You hold me in your arms and squeeze me
And you leave me, makin' me blue

'Cause then I think of you, baby
Nothin' else seems to matter
'Cause when I think of you, baby
All I think about is our love

So in love
Ooh
With you
Baby
Ooh
Hee
With you


When I think of you
When I think of you
Bass

I'm so in love
I just think of you
If you're not around, I'm
When I think of you


Ooh
So in love
With you
Baby, you
Ooh
So in love
With you

Hahahaha
Feels so good
When I think of you
Yeah, yeah
Baby
