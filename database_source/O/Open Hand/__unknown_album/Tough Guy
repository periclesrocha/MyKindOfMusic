I feel like I've lost trust in everyone,
They say deception is the key.

I want to go with you now,
I need to step away,
That's if your going my way,
I've failed again but it's ok,
The situations upside down for me.

I feel like I've lost touch with everyone,
My perception is unclear,
I'll see if I can go with you again,
Things change, the old cliche,
"How's it going, same as yesterday",

I want to go with you now,
I need to step away,
That's if your going my way,
I've failed again but it's ok,
The situations upside down for me,

I feel so run down inside... I feel so run down.

I feel like I've lost trust in everyone,
They say deception is the key.

I want to go with you now,
I need to step away,
That's if your going my way,
I've failed again but it's ok,
The situations upside down for me.

should I save it up inside?
Oh man, I hope I have the time,
And I want to let you know how far I was willing to go.
