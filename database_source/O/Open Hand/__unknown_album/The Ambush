We've been found out,
She's been left out, and she can't relate,
It doesn't matter what we say.

Cause I know we may fall down,
It's safe to lay down or run away,
She said for now that she will remain my if I stay.

She's losing out and I'm feeling so down,
And out with myslef,
It doesn't matter we will change.. our world.

We may fall down,
It's safe to lay down or run away,
She said for now that she will remain my if I stay.

You let me down,
But it's all right,
There is nothing left of what I used to be,
You let me down but i'ts all right,
I feel all right now,
You let me down but it's all right.
