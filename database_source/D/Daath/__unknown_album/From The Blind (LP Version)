Seasons pass by the shells/of the names unknown /silent a void of thought darkening/cells of the mind

Taken from the blind/scorn for all their kind/their lives we bind

Within the throne

Secret overtone

The people chanting

Not heard as they're trampled over

Rise in fury/the start of progress

The broken promise

You place your full trust in

Rise in fury/the start of progress

The broken promise/you place your...

Reason spills out like/our shouts to ears unheard/your thoughts devoid from enlightening/cells of the mind

Taken from the blind/scorn for all their kind/their lives we bind

Within the throne

Secret overtone

The people chanting

Not heard as they're trampled over

Rise in fury/the start of progress

The broken promise

You place your full trust in

Rise in fury/the start of progress

The broken promise/you place your...

This avulsion, eager for divulsion

Thrust on limitless livestock, our battle waged

From the mist of diversion, our force shall further

The reign of blood, for ages to come...

Thoughts behind lock and key

Talk inside cause they won't go free

Silence is their only decree

Die inside cause they can't go free

[Double Solo - Levi/Werstler]

[Solo - Werstler]

Reason spills out like/our shouts to ears unheard/silent a void of thought darkening/cells of the mind

Taken from the blind/scorn for all their kind/their lives we bind

Within the throne

Secret overtone

The people chanting

Not heard as they're trampled over

Rise in fury/the start of progress

The broken promise

You place your full trust in

Rise in fury/the start of progress

The broken promise/you place your...

Rise in fury/the start of progress

The broken promise

You place your full trust in

Rise in fury/the start of progress

The broken promise/you place your...
