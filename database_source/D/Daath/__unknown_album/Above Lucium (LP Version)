Beyond/your sun/beyond/mundane fate

Bind the mass repression/broken teeth on/burnt possessions

You fall apart/soul repression

Without chains/you falter

Beyond/your sun/beyond/mundane fate

Neck-chains bind/the masses

Muffled cries wail/from ashes

Consulting peace/the unrepentant

Without chains/the feral

Above lucium/above lucium/above lucium

Lay sonnelion/in your mind

Taste pity/from the harlot's tongue

Red tunnel/comfort of my lips

Hate finds/heart in submission

Your crooked ways/your reputation

Drowned in a mixed emotion

Might be/something wrong - with - you

Beyond/your sun/beyond/mundane fate

Bind the mass repression/broken teeth on/burnt possessions

You fall apart/soul repression

Without chains/you falter

Above lucium/above lucium/above lucium

Lay sonnelion/in your mind

Taste pity/from the harlot's tongue

Red tunnel/comfort of my lips

Hate finds/heart in submission

Your crooked ways/your reputation

Drowned in a mixed emotion

Might be/something wrong - with - you

Lost in the trenches of dreams/waking gleams beyond/treason calling from the void before me/slut/in the trenches of dreams/waking gleams beyond/treason calling from the void before me

Slut/empty born child/from the womb is torn/deviating form/sonnelion is born

Look beyond me/it's/it's evolved

The force shall withdraw/the boundaries

Beyond me/it's/it's evolved

An empty offspring/drove me on/an empty offspring/drove me on/an empty offspring/drove me on/an empty offspring/drove me on

Above lucium/above lucium/above lucium

Lay sonnelion/in your mind

Taste pity/from the harlot's tongue

Red tunnel/comfort of my lips

Hate finds/heart in submission

Your crooked ways/your reputation

Drowned in a mixed emotion

Might be/something wrong - with - you
