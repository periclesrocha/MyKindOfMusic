Y'all got to feel me on this
Every ghetto feel me on this
Alright

It's bad when u broke
Trust me, I know, this is everyday living for me
Can y'all feel me when I say that?
Yeah, I'm telling you it's bad when u broke
Trust me, I know, this is everyday living for me, yes
And I'm still in the gutter, man

Lord, give me a sign and let me know
When you blessed this life of mine
'Cause it's hard hustlin' in these streets, oh yeah

Lord, give me a sign and let me know
When these old bill collectors
And my baby mama will quit stessin' me
Somebody sing, "It is bad"

It's bad when u broke
Trust me, I know, this is everyday living for me
Can y'all feel me when I say that?
Yeah, I'm telling you it's bad when u broke
Trust me, I know, this is everyday living for me, yes
And I'm still in the gutter, man

Whatcha know about chasing your dreams
Government cheese, praying so long
You got blood on your knees
Watchin' mama cry, go in the bed at night
Tryin' be a man, tears all in your eyes

All my degrees come from the streets
My punk ass daddy never did shit for me
But I'm a stand tall through it all
But if I had some dope things would be different y'all

It's bad when u broke
Trust me, I know, this is everyday living for me
Can y'all feel me when I say that?
Yeah, I'm telling you it's bad when u broke
Trust me, I know, this is everyday living for me, yes
And I'm still in the gutter, man

What am I suppose to do when the lights are off?
And what I'm suppose to do when the gas is off?
Baby in the crib crying for something to eat
Baby, mama, in my ear yelling at me

So it's time to hit the streets, catch somebody slippin'
And creep up behind them and carry out my mission
I wish I didn't have to live my life this way
But that's how it is when your in the gutter, man

It's bad when u broke
Trust me, I know, this is everyday living for me
Can y'all feel me when I say that?
Yeah, I'm telling you it's bad when u broke
Trust me, I know, this is everyday living for me, yes
And I'm still in the gutter, man

It's bad when u broke
Trust me, I know, this is everyday living for me
Can y'all feel me when I say that?
Yeah, I'm telling you, it's bad when u broke
Trust me, I know, this is everyday living for me, yes
And I'm still in the gutter, man
