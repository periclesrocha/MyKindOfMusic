After all I've done for you, the things you say, the things you do the way you
treat me. I don't deserve this. I brought you from nothing and turn you into
something and this the thanks I get, damn.

Tell me why you say things you don't really mean
Tell me why you always wanna fight with me
When I gave you everything
Tell me why you wanna be so mean
Tell me why you wanna say theses things
Baby girl I don't understand why
Why should I even try

Tell me why you say things you don't really mean
Tell me why you always wanna fight with me
