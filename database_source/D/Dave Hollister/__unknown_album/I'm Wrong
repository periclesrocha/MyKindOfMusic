You can leave
You'll come runnin back to me you'll see
that's how and old boy use to think
like you was supposed to do what I said do.
Now I'm tripping cause you walked away
and all I see is clouds and rainy days
only one thing I want to say
I got to be a man about it I shouldn't been treating you that way I was
wrong.

I'm wrong, wrong I've been so wrong the only girl I ever loved is gone she
won't come back to me, won't come back to me no.
I'm wrong, wrong I've been so wrong the only girl I ever loved is gone she
won't come back to me, won't come back to me no.

I'm a fool God knows cause I been mistreating you I know I've gotta change
gotta be a man if there's a chance please come back to me please

I just want to lay it on the line I've cheated and I've lied butl I can't
survive
without you in my life I wanna change all my wrongs help me make this a happy
home I'll get down on my knees just please come back to me please

I'm wrong, wrong I've been so wrong the only girl I ever loved is gone she
won't come back to me, won't come back to me no.
I'm wrong, wrong I've been so wrong the only girl I ever loved is gone she
won't come back to me, won't come back to me no.

Girl I need you I really need you so come back to me. I know I mistreated you
don't deserve to see you but come back to me. I'm going on to the only one I've
ever thought was mine. Running out of time yes I am baby girl I know

I'm wrong, wrong I've been so wrong the only girl I ever loved is gone she
won't come back to me, won't come back to me no.
I'm wrong, wrong I've been so wrong the only girl I ever loved is gone she
won't come back to me, won't come back to me no.

I'm wrong I've been so wrong the only girl I ever loved is gone she won't come
back to me, won't come back to me no.
I'm wrong I've been so wrong the only girl I ever loved is gone she won't come
back to me, won't come back to me no.

Oh my, oh my, oh my
