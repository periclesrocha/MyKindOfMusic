Can you live without one red cent?
Can a little true heart really pay the rent?
No, it'll take a lot of give to get
All the money you've spent it's a game of pressure
So put a little on the back of someone else
'Cause another problem just to ease yourself
Can't you see that it's coming back around, and when it comes back
It'll drive you farther down
It'll drive you farther down...

(Chorus)
Free—how are you?
Is it life that holds us down?
Free—now are you?
When I'm stuck here on the ground

Can you fly without your wings on board?
It seems pretty unfair to end up on the floor
Paying for a crime you weren't charged for
Alive in a world that always wants more
Is it any wonder that you're falling back
Inside the pattern that defines all you lack?
Don't you want to get into your car and get out of this town?
Get out of this town?



When I'm stuck here on the ground

It's all about the wrong thing
If doesn't make your heart sing
It couldn't be the right place
With those tears upon your face



Free—now are you? [x5]
