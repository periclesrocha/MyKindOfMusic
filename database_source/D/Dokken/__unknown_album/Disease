You never saw me comin'
With your naive eyes
You're the right kind of spirit
With the right kind of time
Now you don't pay attention
We get off with a bang
Your reckless obsession
Washed away all your shine

I'm you disease

You embrace my infection
When I cross your lips
You pretend not to notice
When I tighten my grip
I'm your brand-new monkey
On your back if you please
Gonna show you no mercy
When I feed your disease

I'm your disease

I could never ignore you
Any time that we meet
No sign of it slowin'
When you're dead on your feet
I'm your brand-new monkey
On your back if you please
Gonna show you no mercy
When I feed your disease

I'm your disease
