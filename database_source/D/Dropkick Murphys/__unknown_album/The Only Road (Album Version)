How could you choose a path without knowing
where you'd end up
Where you came from was a time and
place that you had never been

(Is this the only road)

Can you fake your way through conversation
or just simply turn away
Set a course for the desert sun

Is this the only choice
To live without a choice,
this is the only choice we'll know

Cut your teeth and now it's time to show the world that what your made of
Was a travesty that many just call luck

(Is this the only road)

Now climb aboard the red line train that's headed out of town
Or stick around and just relive your past

Is this the only choice
To live without a choice,
this is the only choice we'll know

You're always running out of wind and you keep saying it's the end
You're always hoping that you'll win,
but then you throw in the towel in
