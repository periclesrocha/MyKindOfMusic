Your love is like dark matter
Your love it’s hard to explain
Your love is like dark matter
And I will never be the same

Just another black echo in my head
You paint me in colours but instead
You’re just another black echo in my head
You’re painting me, I paint it black

Oh my father
Oh my father
Oh my father always told me so
But I still didn’t know

Oh my father
Oh my father
Oh my father always told me so
But I still didn’t know

She had your love once
Unconditional
But she feels lost now
A little, out of control (a little, out of control)

Now an invisible barrier
Around her skin
Protects her from danger
It won’t let anyone in
Won’t let you in…

Just another black echo in my head
You paint me in colours but instead
You’re just another black echo in my head
You’re painting me, I paint it black

Just another black echo in my head
You paint me in colours but instead
You’re just another black echo in my head
You’re painting me, I paint it black

Oh my father
Oh my father
Oh my father always told me so
But I still didn’t know

Oh my father
Oh my father
Oh my father always told me so
But I still didn’t know

You’re painting me, I paint it black

Oh no

Just another echo
