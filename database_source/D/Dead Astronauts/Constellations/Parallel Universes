I never wanted us to be like this
I never wanted us to be like this
I never wanted us to be like this
I never wanted us to be like this

When words are like knives
They cut in syllables
Like matter and anti-matter
We’ve become so separable

I never wanted
Us to be like this
I never wanted
I never wanted this

Thrown in space
Glass roof and a metal bar
Cigarette trace still there when I’m in the car
Trash it all, trash it all
Voices through a paper wall
Trash it all, trash it all
Thick skin don’t call

Thrown in space (I never wanted this)
Glass roof and a metal bar (I never wanted this)
Cigarette trace still there when I’m in the car (I never wanted this)
Trash it all, trash it all (I never wanted this)
Voices through a paper wall (I never wanted this)
Trash it all, trash it all (I never wanted this)
Thick skin don’t call (I never wanted this)

I never wanted this
I never wanted this
I never wanted this
I never wanted this

Like parallel universes
In different strands of time
This distance immeasurable
We’re too far away

I never wanted us to be like this
I never wanted us to be like this

Thrown in space
Glass roof and a metal bar
Cigarette trace still there when I’m in the car
Trash it all, trash it all
Voices through a paper wall
Trash it all, trash it all
Thick skin don’t call

Thrown in space (I never wanted this)
Glass roof and a metal bar (I never wanted this)
Cigarette trace still there when I’m in the car (I never wanted this)
Trash it all, trash it all (I never wanted this)
Voices through a paper wall (I never wanted this)
Trash it all, trash it all (I never wanted this)
Thick skin don’t call (I never wanted this)

I never wanted
Us to be like this

I never wanted
I never wanted this

I never wanted
Us to be like this

I never wanted
I never wanted this
