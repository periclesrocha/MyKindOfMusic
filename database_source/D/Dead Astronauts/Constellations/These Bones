These bones have left you nothing
Nothing to hold onto
These bones have left, and no one is left to care about you

They'll always kick you when you're down
Down without a clue
They know just when you're feeling weak
And they'll rip right through you

These bones have left you (these bones)
And your blood runs cold (blood runs cold)
These bones have left you
With no one to hold (no one to hold)

These bones have left you (these bones)
And your blood runs cold (blood runs cold)
These bones have left you
With no one to hold (no one to hold)

These bones, blood runs cold
These bones, no one

These bones, blood runs cold
These bones, no one

These bones, blood runs cold
These bones, no one

These bones, blood runs cold
These bones, no one

These bones have left you nothing
Nothing to go home to
These bones have left, and no one is left to care about you

They know the places you'll be found
And where you've been refused
Where your voice in the dark's the only friend you know
And they'll leave you beaten and bruised

These bones have left you (these bones)
And your blood runs cold (blood runs cold)
These bones have left you
With no one to hold (no one to hold)

These bones have left you (these bones)
And your blood runs cold (blood runs cold)
These bones have left you
With no one to hold (no one to hold)

These bones have left you (these bones)
And your blood runs cold (blood runs cold)
These bones have left you
With no one to hold (no one to hold)

These bones have left you (these bones)
And your blood runs cold (blood runs cold)
These bones have left you
With no one to hold (no one to hold)

These bones, blood runs cold
These bones, no one

These bones, blood runs cold
These bones, no one

These bones, blood runs cold
These bones, no one

These bones, blood runs cold
These bones, no one
