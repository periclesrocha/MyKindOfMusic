Every time it rains
Pennies from heaven
Don't you know each cloud contains
Pennies from heaven

You'll find your fortune falling
All over town
Be sure that your umbrella
Is upside down
Trade them for a package of
Sunshine and flowers
And if you want the things you love
You must have showers
So when you hear it thunder
Don't run under a tree
They'll be pennies from heaven
For you and me
