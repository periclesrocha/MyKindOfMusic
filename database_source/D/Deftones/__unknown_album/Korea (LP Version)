I taste you much better
Off teeth taste
Of white skin on red leather
Check the claws we got

Night time cavity
To come in
Downtown pony
Work your pitch

I came to in feathers
Like leaves taste
You rubbed me together
With claws like we got

Night time cavity
To come in
Downtown pony
Work your pitch
Daytime dancer
I'll come inside
Got my teacher
Now carve your niche

Check the claws

It's yours
It's yours
Your turn to come inside

Night time cavity
To come in
Downtown pony
Work your pitch
Daytime dancer
I'll come inside
Got my teacher
Carve your niche
