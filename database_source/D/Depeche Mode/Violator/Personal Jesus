Reach out and touch faith

Your own
Personal
Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers
Someone who cares

Your own (your own)
Personal
Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers
Someone who’s there

Feeling unknown
And you’re all alone
Flesh and bone
By the telephone
Lift up the receiver
I’ll make you a believer

Take second best
Put me to the test
Things on your chest
You need to confess
I will deliver
You know I’m a forgiver

Reach out and touch faith

Reach out and touch faith

Your own
Personal
Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers
Someone who cares

Your own (your own)
Personal
Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers
Someone who’s there

Feeling unknown
And you’re all alone
Flesh and bone
By the telephone (telephone)
Lift up the receiver
I’ll make you a believer

I will deliver
You know I’m a forgiver

Reach out and touch faith

Your own
Personal
Jesus

Reach out and touch faith

Reach out and touch faith

Reach out and touch faith

(Reach out, reach out)

Reach out and touch faith

Reach out and touch faith
