Can you feel a little love

As your bony fingers close around me
Long and spindly death becomes me
Heaven can you see what I see

Hey you pale and sickly child
You’re death and living reconciled
Been walking home a crooked mile

Paying debt to karma you party for a living
What you take won’t kill you
But careful what you’re giving

There’s no time for hesitating
Pain is ready, pain is waiting
Primed to do it’s educating

Unwanted, uninvited kin
It creeps beneath your crawling skin
It lives without it lives within you

Feel the fever coming you’re shaking and twitching
You can scratch all over
But that won’t stop you itching

Can you feel a little love
Can you feel a little love
Dream on, dream on

Blame it on your karmic curse
Or shame upon the universe
It knows its lines, it’s well rehearsed

It sucked you in, it dragged you down
To where there is no hallow ground
Where holiness is never found

Paying debt to karma you party for a living
What you take won’t kill you
But careful what you’re giving

Can you feel a little love
Can you feel a little love
Dream on, dream on

Can you feel a little love
Can you feel a little love
Dream on, dream on
Dream on, dream on
Dream on, dream on
