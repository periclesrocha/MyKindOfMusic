If you’ve been hiding from love
If you’ve been hiding from love
I can understand where you’re coming from
I can understand where you’re coming from

If you’ve suffered enough
If you’ve suffered enough
I can understand what you’re thinking of
I can see the pain that you’re frightened of

And I’m only here
To bring you free love
Let’s make it clear
That this is free love
No hidden catch
No strings attached
Just free love
No hidden catch
No strings attached
Just free love

I’ve been running like you
I’ve been running like you
Now you understand why I’m running scared
Now you understand why I’m running scared

I’ve been searching for truth
I’ve been searching for truth
And I haven’t been getting anywhere
No, I haven’t been getting anywhere

And I’m only here
To bring you free love
Let’s make it clear
That this is free love
No hidden catch
No strings attached
Just free love
No hidden catch
No strings attached
Just free love

Hey girl, you’ve got to take this moment
Then let it slip away
Let go of complicated feelings
Then there’s no price to pay

We’ve been running from love
We’ve been running from love
And we don’t know what we’re doing here
No, we don’t know what we’re doing here

We’re only here
Sharing our free love
Let’s make it clear
That this is free love
No hidden catch
No strings attached
Just free love
No hidden catch
No strings attached
Just free love
No hidden catch
No strings attached
Just free love
No hidden catch
No strings attached
Just free love

(Free love, free love, free love, free love)
(Free love, free love, free love, free love)
(Free love, free love, free love, free love)
(Free love, free love, free love, free love)
