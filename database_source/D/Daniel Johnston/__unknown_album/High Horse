I was thinking about your love
You was only hiding, like the lord above
Looking down like an angel, upon my lonely life
And no matter the angle, I want you to be my wife

I was dreaming, you understood
You were thinking, you wished you would
Looking down form your high horse
Like I didn't matter, of course

What they say at the funeral, it darkens and remorse
You were thinking I was sleeping in my thoughts
So lonely my tears fall down my brain
Rode my train for a cheap price, baby it's no surprise

Looking down from your high horse
Listening to my lullaby
I was thinking, that the world of sin
A sinking feeling, like I'm falling in love again

Looking down from your high horses
Like I didn't matter, of course
Say hello at my funeral
I'll be right there on time

You could only be my love
Dated like the stars above
You could only be my love, love, love
