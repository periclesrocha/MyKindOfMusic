Wow, beautiful. We’re gonna go to our very first caller, we’re going to Judy, line four, Oshawa, you’re on the air. Hello Judy.

Asking the question, Judy, how has rejection affected your life?

This group of people, they rejected me. Like… like, they… they rejected me, one person in particular, but I don’t wanna say his name.

No.

’cause… ’cause I… I’ve forgiven and forgotten about it.

I took a dive in Oshawa.

I took a dive in Oshawa.

I took a dive in Oshawa.

I took a dive in Oshawa.

I took a dive in Oshawa.
