You don't use our music to get high
Then use our music to get by

Break!!

(Chorus)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-oo-oo-ooh
Ohh, ba-doo-do-doo-doo-doo
Follow the lights, they
Lead to something...
Ooh-ooh, ooh-oo-oo-ooh
Ohh, ba-doo-do-doo-doo-doo
Follow the lights, they
Lead to something...
Ooh-ooh, ooh-oo-oo-ooh
Ohh, ba-doo-do-doo-doo-doo
Follow the lights, they
Lead to something...

The time we're face-in, uhh
Get off your feet cuz time is wast-in, uh
Must be strong in this situatio-in, well
So raise your hand and let's start takin, let's start takin
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go

(Big Boi)
Even In Darkness
Darker than the Lochness monster's dwelling
It don't scare me, that's fairy telling
But what about Hell and Heaven?
Nothin is that ir-rel-ev-ent, you must find yourself, your intent
Don't commit thyself, cuz another nigga done did it
In and outta style like leather African pennants
Say that your with the spirit, follow the Ten Commandments
Mad Mixmaster said, "Now can ya spin it?" Say NOW!!

(Chorus)

(Big Gipp)
Gipp the epiphany
I wanna be remembered in infamy
Composer and producer of the symphony
I done had struggles in my life, so I know that it was meant for me
You sent for me
Showed me light through the power of chi and your intent to see
You teach for He, discretely
Givin them a piece of me -- the peace was free, gone

What I need, what I want, what I say
Is two different things, two different...

(Chorus)

(Cee-Lo)
Lord, It was so elequent-aly, I emerged from the sorta verse
Origin purpose be partially profound of the very power that's in me
When God said he so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son
I thought he meant me
Jesus is my older brother evidently, experiment in me
Let the complexity collapse the pocket quickly
Life is but a dream, ya row ya boat gently
It's cool to have a Bentley, I want a Bentley
Yet I ponder why, I smoke my presence prominently?
If you want your mind blown, look we're all alone... Follow the light

(Chorus to fade)
