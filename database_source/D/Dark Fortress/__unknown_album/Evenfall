With the dawn
Comes the loathing
With the morning
Comes the fall

With the qualm
Come the vermin
Come to spawn
From the sun they crawl

With the night
Dies the calm
With revulsion
Comes the spite

With the light
Come the lightmares
Waking Moloch
Comes with the fall

Succumb
Withdraw your soul from this fallacy
This infamy is not for us

With the night
Comes deliverance
Comes the spark
That sets us alight

With the dark
Comes remembrance
Comes the halo
Comes the flight

And the ground takes a fall

Torn upon winds of witchery
Resplendent wings unfold
Revelling in lucid lechery
We invoke what no eye can behold

Azure, her gaping portal
I blaze in ecstasy
The goddess calls, immortal
Shrugs off all treachery

Stay down
Wait for evenfall
For the night to embrace us again
Wait for evenfall

Sleep now
Wait for evenfall
For the abyss will set us free
Wait for evenfall
