In mysterious ways your soul sinks down
As eerie constellations told before
This time you cannot hide
A maelstrom of inhuman fears
And the only way goes down... down... down...

Gone days of phantasmagoria
Welcome to the necromantic gallery
Where nightmares become so real
And souls are stigmatized with the sign of impurity

Desolation all around
Welcome to the promised land
Where no single beam of light ever touched the ground
Life eternal in a traumatic fade

Believe me this is not a dream
These dead eyes you are gazing at are yours
Call it heaven, call it hell..

Call it heaven, call it hell...
This is where the restless dwell!
Call it heaven, call it hell...
This is where the restless dwell!
Call it heaven, call it hell...
This is where the restless dwell!
Call it heaven, call it hell...
This is where the restless dwell!



Misshapen silhouettes so awake
Black faces and only shades of grey
Distorted incantations
And prayers for aeons unheard
In wastelands of delusion.
