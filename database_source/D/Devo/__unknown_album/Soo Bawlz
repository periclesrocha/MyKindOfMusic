Pretty mongo
Everybody wants her toilet
Same old story
She don't let no-one near it

The way she teases them
It's such a shame
She's got all the huboons
Crying out her name

Soo bawls, soo bawls
She's got them howling
She's got them growling
Soo bawls, soo bawls
She's got them going clean out of their minds
Soo bawls, soo bawls
Soo bawls, soo bawls

Ain't a man in town
Who wouldnâ€™t have her for his daughter
They'd all trade their brains
For one taste of her toilet water

The way she teases them
It's such a shame
She's got all the huboons
Crying out her name

Soo bawls, soo bawls
Soo bawls, soo bawls
Soo bawls, soo bawls
Soo bawls, soo bawls

One, two, three, four
Tell the people what she wore

They run in circles
Trying hard to call her up
But her phone's been disconnected
Since she sold her butt

The way she teases them
It's such a shame
She's got all the huboons
Crying out her name

Soo bawls, soo bawls
She's got them howling
She's got them growling
Soo bawls, soo bawls
She's got them going clean out of their minds
Soo bawls, soo bawls
Soo bawls, soo bawls
