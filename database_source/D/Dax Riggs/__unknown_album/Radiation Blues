Bury this song and the rhythm of breath. There is only death

Maybe you're dead and ya just don't know
A shadow dressed only in sorrow
Tomorrow might not exist and ya should've been dead
x2

Should've been dead like ten times over
Like ten times over

Should've been dead like ten times over
By the hand of your lover
On the side of the river should've been dead

Should've been dead like ten times over
Like ten times over
x2

Bury this song and the rhythm of breath
There is only death
There is only death,
There is only breath

These radiation blues, sister
Gonna make me true
Movin' through the bones of you
These radiation blues
Movin', movin', movin', movin'
Movin', movin', movin', movin'

Should've been dead like ten times over
Like ten times over
x2
