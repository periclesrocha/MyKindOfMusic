What will you do when your walls come down?
You should have turned your heart
You should have turned it around

You thought you were safe
Behind your iron and clay walls
I told you long ago that you were due for a fall

Jericho,
You're gonna be the slave of the master's servants
Jericho,
Your cities are burning and the soldiers are coming for you

Your wall street idols won't be here long
From cinders to ashes and they are all gone
I begged you to run from your idols to Me
But blind by fools gold no you just couldn't see
