Clear your tears
And dry your eyes
We live in fear
And drunken lies

Douse the flames
Of evil dawning
The cold blade falls
On misty morning

And for their sins
We live and die
The angel cowers
In blackened skies

So take my hand and walk again
We’ll take a walk through yellow rain

She’s calling
Just calling

She’s calling
Just calling

So now’s the time
We hear the calling
While lovers feast
By mirrored pools

A million cries
From shattered faces
We dance the tune
To the pipes of gold

She’s calling
Just calling

She’s calling
Just calling

She’s calling
Just calling

She’s calling
Just calling

She’s calling
Just calling

She’s calling
Just calling

She’s calling
Just calling

She’s calling
Just calling

She’s calling
Just calling
