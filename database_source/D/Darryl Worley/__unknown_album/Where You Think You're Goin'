(Wynn Varble/Shawn Camp/Brice Long)

You've packed up the cups and dishes
Loaded down the car
Hold your horses just a minute
Before you get too far
Where you think you're goin' darlin'
Where you think you're goin' with my heart

You can have the 'frigerator and the new TV
Take the pictures off the wall
That's alright by me but
Where you think you're goin' sweet pea
Where you think you're goin' with my heart

Girl, we had a good thing goin'
Now you're gonna leave
But you've got somethin' that belongs to me
Look at me now, can't you see
It's tearin' me apart
Where you think you're goin' sugar puddin'
Where you think you're goin' with my heart

If that's what you want
Is for me to just break right down
I just might do it

Girl, we had a good thing goin'
But now you're gonna leave
But you've got somethin' that belongs to me
Look at me now, can't you see
It's tearin' me apart
Where you think you're goin' honey bunny
Where you think you're goin' with my heart

Where you think you're goin' sweet cheeks
Where you think you're goin' with my heart

Come back here with that
You can't take everything
Don't you want to kiss me
Just for the good times
It's goin' be sad and lonesome here
Without you
