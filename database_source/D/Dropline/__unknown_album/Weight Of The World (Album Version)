I am just an open book
for everyone to take a look
do my insecurities alarm you

and you can fill me up with novicane
and lithium to ease my brain
but it doesn't seem to change my point of view

I was lost and couldn't hear you
closed my eyes and couldn't see you
but everything about you is revealing

you can take the blame from me
lock it up without the key
don't you know the whole world isn't stealing
from you

Chorus:
and sometimes she puts the weight of the world on me
and she don't notice
sometimes she puts the weight of the world
yeah
yeah yeah yeah

if you wondered what you did to me
I tangled with security
left me in the street
for dead and bleeding

but your friends all said you went away
but I think I got it right today
thought that there's a chance that you might need me

well do you?

(Chorus)

and you can take that hard look
you can take that
you can take that
and you can take that hard look

I am just an open book
for everyone to take a look
do my insecurities alarm you

you can fill me up with novicane
lithium to ease my brain
but it doesn't seem to change my point of view
about you
you

(Chorus x2)
