Overtime everyday of the week still the house ain't big enough,
Spend your money so fast that you never see the green,
Big, better, best tell me where does it end,
Keeping up with the Joneses is tough

Better open your eyes boy, she just wanna buy buy buy,
Better wake up boy, I'll tell you why

She's got a mean streak,
But you love her so much you don't want to see her mean streak,
Everybody knows she's got you on a leash, mean streak,
Well she'll laugh in your face, but your kissing her feet,
Your never good enough in the eyes of a woman with a mean streak

Every time that I look at you boy, I can see your a nervous wreck,
You try to hard to give her every little thing,
Big car, big pool, big house heart attack,
You better bend, or your gonna break

How far does it take you,
She just wanna buy buy buy,
She's gonna break you, I'll tell you why

It could be different now, if you'd only say goodbye,
But your too weak to try,
Things won't change, till you open up your eyes,
How could you be so blind
