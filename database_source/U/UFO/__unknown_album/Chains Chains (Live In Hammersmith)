Jack of diamonds is a gambling man
He played the tables whenever he can
Take some advice boy stay clean stay out of his way
Little Jeannie is a dancing queen
She's been shaking it since she was sixteen
Skips across the tables acting out her passion play

It wasn't for money, it's only a chance
You take a gamble, got shot for romance

Chains, chains pulling you down
Chain of love that turns your world around
Chains chains pulling you down
Chain of love that turns your world around

Without a warning Jeannie took off one night
Jack got so mean boy, he just had to fight
He died on the floor someone else evens the score
Back on the tables Jeannie's romance had died
That one look of love that told her a lie
And for her there's no waves crashing on seashores

It wasn't for money, it's only a chance
You take a gamble, got shot for romance

Chains, chains pulling you down
Chain of love that turns your world around
Chains chains pulling you down
Chain of love that turns your world around

Chains chains...chains chains...
