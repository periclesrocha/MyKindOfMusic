Me and Mot were rockin' out back in his bedroom
Underneath a tapestry of a Motley Crue back in their youth
No time to just wake up from dreamin'!

Brokyn Needle doesn't need no cigarettes cause we're that cool
Basement majesties and desperate hearts,
Yeah, but it's okay jammin' after school
cause I'm gonna be a star!

I got a muscle shirt and Mot has got some black boots
Pink bandanna, glitter jeans and a fake tattoo and you're set, dude
No time to just wake up from dreamin'!

Brokyn Needle doesn't need no cigarettes cause we're that cool
Basement majesties and desperate hearts,
Yeah, but it's okay jammin' after school
cause I'm gonna be a star!

singin'....
"Are You Ready To Rock?"
It's not a question, baby!
"Are You Ready To Rock?"
It's not a question, baby!
Cause I'm just filled with somethin'
It's all I got

Brokyn Needle doesn't need no cigarettes cause we're that cool
Basement majesties and desperate hearts,
Yeah, but it's okay jammin' after school
cause I'm gonna be a star!
