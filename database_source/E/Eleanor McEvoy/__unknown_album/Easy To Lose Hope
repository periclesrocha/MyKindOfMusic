I
My home town's dear to me, it's always in my sight
(but) My city's shadows walk around in broad daylight
They'll even shoot a woman down for what she writes
So now you pay for civil liberty with life

CHORUS
So hard it's easy to lose hope for everyone
So bad it's easier to never take it on
But we can't give up
And we can't lose hope
And we cannot hide away
We can overcome
But we must be strong
And we must not be afraid

II
You must not ever stop the search for peace within
Cause if you find it, there's no better prize to win
In losing peace of mind you're losing everything
Don't draw away from it whatever shape you're in

CHORUS
So hard it's easy to lose hope for everyone
So bad it's easier to never take it on
But we can't give up
And we can't lose hope
And we cannot hide away
We can overcome
But we must be strong
And we must not be afraid

III
With all our songs and stories we have brushed aside
The very nature of a beast we tried to hide
With all the ugliness this city has to fight
How could we leave it to a mother and a wife?

CHORUS
So hard it's easy to lose hope for everyone
So bad it's easier to never take it on
But we can't give up
And we can't lose hope
And we cannot hide away
We can overcome
But we must be strong
And we must not be afraid
We must not be afraid
We must not be afraid

CHORUS
But we can't give up
And we can't lose hope
And we cannot hide away
We can overcome
But we must be strong
And we must not be
We must not be afraid
We must not be afraid
