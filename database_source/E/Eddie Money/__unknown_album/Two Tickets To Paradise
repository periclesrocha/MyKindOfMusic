I've got a surprise especially for you
It's something that both of us have always wanted to do
And you've waited so long, you've waited so long
You've waited so long, you've waited so long

I'm gonna take you on a trip so far from here
I've got two tickets in my pocket, now baby, we're gonna disappear
We've waited so long, you've waited so long
We've waited so long, we've waited so long

I've got two tickets to paradise
Won't you pack your bags, we'll leave tonight
I've got two tickets to paradise
I've got two tickets to paradise

Whoa-oh ooh-whoa ooh-whoa ooh-whoa ooh-whoa ooh-whoa-oa
Whoa-oh ooh-whoa ooh-whoa ooh-whoa ooh-whoa ooh-whoa-oa

I'm gonna take you on a trip so far from here
I've got two tickets in my pocket, baby, we'll disappear
You know why?
You've waited so long, you've waited so long
We've waited so long, we've waited so long

I've got two tickets to paradise
Won't you pack your bags, we'll leave tonight
I've got two tickets to paradise
Won't you pack your bags, we'll leave tonight

I've got two tickets to paradise
Won't you pack your bags, we'll leave tonight
I've got two tickets to paradise
I've got two tickets to paradise
