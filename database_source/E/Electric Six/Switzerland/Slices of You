I’m late for dinner but look who’s on the menu
’Cause when I’m in a hurry, nothing tastes as good as you do
Whisper in my ear all your culinary wishes
Next thing you know, you’re washing the dishes
Your table is ready, follow me
I’m happy to seat you

Slices of you
I’d really like another slice of you (slices of you)
That’s so nice of you
I’d really like another slice of you
That’s so nice of you (slices of you)
I’d really like another slice or two
(Slices of you)
I’d really like another slice of you

I’m late for dinner but look who’s on the menu
’Cause when I get a table you know damn well I get a table for two
Preheat the oven so to cook in your pants
I trained at the very best kitchens in France
My service is slow and I hope this doesn’t offend you

Slices of you
I’d really like another slice of you (slices of you)
That’s so nice of you
I’d really like another slice of you
That’s so nice of you (slices of you)
I’d really like another slice or two
(Slices of you)
I’d really like another slice of you

And everywhere I go, people ask me,
“Valentine, what’s your recipe for love?”
My answer’s always the same:
“Cook the hell out of it and slice it”

If music be the food of love, play on
But I’m really too hungry for just one song
And so I pose a final plea to you
I’d really like another slice of you
That’s so nice of you (slices of you)
I’d really like another slice of you
(Slices of you)
I’d really like another slice of you

I’m late for dinner but look who’s on the menu
’Cause when I’m in a hurry nothing tastes as good as you do

I’m late for dinner but look who’s on the menu
’Cause when I’m in a hurry nothing tastes as good as you do

I’m late for dinner but look who’s on the menu…
