A-ah

Everybody’s doin’
What they shouldn’t be doin’
Everybody’s doin’ it
In the middle of the street

Everybody’s movin’
What they shouldn’t be movin’
Everybody’s movin’ it
In the middle of the street

Improper dancing
In the middle of the street
Improper dancing
In the middle of the street
Improper dancing
In the middle of the street

Somebody better notify the cheif of police

Everybody’s freakin’
Who they shouldn’t be freakin’
Everybody’s freakin’
In the middle of the street

Everybody’s showin’
What they shouldn’t be showin’
Everybody’s showin’ it
In the middle of the street

Improper dancing
In the middle of the street
Improper dancing
In the middle of the street
Improper dancing
In the middle of the street

Man those people must have demons livin’ in their feet

And I want to reach into the fire of your heart
I want to program all those beats right from the start
…have you ever been to New York City?!

And music starts to play (play)
Bodies start to sway (sway)
Debbie Lee’s the DJ
In the middle of the street

Beats are droppin’
Bodies rockin’
Hearts are stoppin’
Electric shockin’
I can’t believe what I am seein’
In the middle of the street

Improper dancing
In the middle of the street
Improper dancing
In the middle of the street
Improper dancing
In the middle of the street

Somebody better notify the cheif of police

Stop!
Continue

Yes!
