Living in the basement and losing my mind
Smoking mother nature until I go blind
And if you live long enough you’re bound to see it all
For example, take the girlie apparition in my hall

Shaking her finger and looking at me,
But there’s something not right about the way she sees
She got white eyes
She say, “everybody here gonna have white eyes”
(She got white eyes)
Unless
Under three pairs of glasses there’s some glass, some glass, some glass

Now a week in the country is just what I need
It gets so quiet I can hear myself bleed
And there’s a moon on the mountain
A wind through the trees
And I still couldn’t tell you how that ghost girl sees
She seems to be committing an optical crime
She is a spectral spectacle looking at me all the time
With white eyes
She say, “everybody here gonna have white eyes”
(She got white eyes)
When they die
And if you’ve got those baby blues, baby, get ready to kiss ’em goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

Things are no longer what they might seem
When her freight train picks up its head of steam
There’s no clear line between death and dream and the ferocious haze of love

Now the gates are swinging open
And I’m coming through
And I can hear the choir start singing their tune
As I take my last steps toward that guiding light
I can hear that ghost laughing as my eyeballs turn white

(I got white eyes)
I say, “everybody here gonna have white eyes”
(I got white eyes)
Like me
It ain’t until you lose your sight that you know just what it means to see
