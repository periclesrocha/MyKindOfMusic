We must escape

We must escape
Our darkest days
Or face the fall
And fade away

We must escape
Our darkest days
Or face the fall
And fade away

There is a place to mourn
Where all the angels pray
And if I close my eyes
I'll see you there again someday

We have been torn apart
Left with our fragile hearts
Still it's yours that's not beating anymore tonight

Darkness is broken by the flame of our love
Lost were we all and still through this we survived

We must escape
Our darkest days
Or face the fall
And fade away

For you we drown in tears
Our sorrow kills our fears
I'll drink the blood from your poisoned heart to be with you

Darkness is broken by the flame of our love
Lost were we all and still through this we survived

Darkness is broken by the flame of our love
Lost were we all and still through this we survived

We must escape our darkest days
