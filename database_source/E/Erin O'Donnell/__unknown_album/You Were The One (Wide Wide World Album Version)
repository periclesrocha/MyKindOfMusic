I lost my mind, I didn't have a clue
I couldn't see, I didn't think it through
But you stayed faithful all the while
It wasn't that I didn't know the truth
It was just I couldn't seem to choose
What I should

So what did I decide? How could I respond?
When I could feel that You still loved me all along
I was so confused and You were so unmoved

When You were the one who came down and stayed close
You were the hand that would not let me go
I make it all about me when it's the wrong thing to do
You were the one, it was You

I messed it up, I wasted so much time
I couldn't see the thing You had in mind
So I stayed the course that I was on
But You were good, You cared enough to stop
You opened up the doors that had been locked
And saved me

I wanted to leave, well, enough alone
I didn't wanna risk, I couldn't seem to grow
I was such a fool and You were staying true

When You were the one who came down and stayed close
You were the hand that would not let me go
I make it all about me when it's the wrong thing to do
You were the one, it was You

So what did I decide? How could I respond?
When I could feel that you still loved me all along
I was so confused and you were being you

When You were the one who came down and stayed close
You were the hand that would not let me go
I make it all about me when it's the wrong thing to do
You were the one

When You were the one who came down and stayed close
You were the hand that would not let me go
I make it all about me when it's the wrong thing to do
You were the one, it was You

You were the one, You were the one
You were the one, You were the one
