Separate from your affliction
Feel alone when I look in your eyes
I’m no longer your addiction
A distant void reflecting in your lies

Don’t
Say a word
Don’t
Cry

You can’t get enough
Under your skin
You can’t get enough
Drawing your sin

You can’t get enough
Under your skin
You can’t get enough

Your lower power is now calling
Spiders crawling through your open pores
In your presence feel you’re falling
I say enough but all you want is more

Don’t
Say a word
Don’t
Lie!

You can’t get enough
Under your skin
You can’t get enough
Drawing your sin

You can’t get enough
Under your skin
You can’t get enough
Enough

You can’t get enough
Under your skin
You can’t get enough
Drawing your sin

You can’t get enough
Under your skin
You can’t get enough
You can’t get enough

You can’t get enough
Under your skin
You can’t get enough
You can’t get enough

You can’t get enough
Under your skin
You can’t get enough
Enough
