Numb and void you're beating me senseless with your spite and your pre-mature midlife crisis fake your sincerity watered down fake your self-image and stain look at you now when I rise you act as if I'm sinking you spreading the lies sad to see you're still clinging what is missing I never took away but if you had it you'd trade it more than I allow is spewing out of me
