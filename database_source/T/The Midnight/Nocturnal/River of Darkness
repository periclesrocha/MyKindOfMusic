Look, I know you miss her man
But you can’t keep doing this to yourself
She’s moved on
Meanwhile you’re out there just…
Walking the streets at night
Alone
In a river of darkness

Glowing windows in the buildings from the elevated train
I see a thousand different stories pass
Faces without names

I forget why I came here
And I forget why I stay
And I wonder if they’d notice
If I slipped away

What if I kept going
What if I don’t get off tonight?
What if I ride this to the edges
Through the darkness to the light

Could I find you there?
Could I find you there?
If I slipped away?

What if there’s no answer
We’re all just hearts that have to fight
Through the dangers of the rapids
Through the darkness to the light

Could I find you there?
Could I find you there?
If I slipped away?

Look, I know you miss her man
But you can’t keep doing this to yourself
She’s moved on
Meanwhile you’re out there just…
Walking the streets at night
Alone
In a river of darkness
