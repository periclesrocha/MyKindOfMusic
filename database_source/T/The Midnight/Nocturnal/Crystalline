Rush hour
On an uptown train
Doors open
And she walks in
She’s soaking
Caught in the rain
Her skin shines
Like crystalline

Eyes meet
You know where this goes
Her key’s in
They take off their clothes
They’re soaking
Caught in a dream
Her skin shines
Like crystalline

The problem with believers
They’ll let anyone in the door
The problem with deceivers
It’s all the bodies buried under the floor boards

Sailors
Knew sirens would sing
From rocks off
The cliffs by the sea
The monsters
With wading teeth
Their skin shined
Crystalline

Rush hour
On an uptown train
Doors open
And she walks in
She’s soaking
Caught in the rain
Her skin shines
Like crystalline

(Crystalline)
