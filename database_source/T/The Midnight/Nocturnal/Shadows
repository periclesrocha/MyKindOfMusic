The city carved a silhouette
On the ocean after dark
Over the lonely and the holy
And the red blood beating hearts

Up from the dirty black water
A shadow void of form
Raised itself out of the river
And it climbed upon the shore

Neon on the black top
There’s gentle rain downtown
The shadow pooling underneath me
As it follows on the ground

Kissed you when I saw you
Stared deep into your eyes
I meant to say "I love you"
But instead I said goodbye

Shadows in the city
I’m a stranger to myself
On these streets I’m someone else
Shadows in the city
Like a demon in the dark
Come to tear us apart

(Beyond our city)
(Shadows — downtown — beyond our city)
(Shadows — downtown — beyond our city)
(Shadows — downtown — beyond our city)
(Shadows — downtown — beyond our city)

For all my good intentions
There’s a shadow in this dark
He comes to me infrequently
And breaks your perfect heart

I don’t know why I do it
Apologize but it’s too late
A single tear and you leave me here
And the shadow slips away

Shadows in the city
I’m a stranger to myself
On these streets I’m someone else
Shadows in the city
Like a demon in the dark
Come to tear us apart

(Beyond our city)
(Shadows — downtown — beyond our city)
(Shadows — downtown — beyond our city)
(Shadows — downtown — beyond our city)
(Shadows — downtown — beyond our city)

(Beyond our city)
(Beyond our city)
(Beyond our city)
(Beyond our city)

(Shadows — downtown — beyond our city)
(Shadows — downtown — beyond our city)
(Shadows — downtown — beyond our city)
(Shadows — downtown — beyond our city)

(Shadows — downtown — beyond our city)
(Shadows — downtown — beyond our city)
(Shadows — downtown — beyond our city)
(Shadows — downtown — beyond our city)
