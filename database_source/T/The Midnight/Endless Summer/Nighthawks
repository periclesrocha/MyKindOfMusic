I see you
You see me
Eighteenth floor
Across the street
Sometimes you dance
Sometimes you read
TV dinners, fall asleep

Do I ever cross your mind
Through your window in the sky
When you forget to close the blinds
So do I

I see you
Check your phone
Wash the dishes
Fold the clothes
Sometimes you stay up
And get stoned
But you always sleep alone

Do I ever cross your mind
Through your window in the sky
When you forget to close the blinds
So do I
