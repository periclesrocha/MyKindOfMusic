The question is will I ever leave You?
The answer is no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

The question is will I ever leave You?
The answer is no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

Oh, I love the Lord for He's so dear to me
Oh, He died that I might be free
I was asked, this question is and the answer is still no

Now the question is will I do His will?
And it's yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

I was at home late one night
The Lord asked me would I do His will
I told Him yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

I'm presenting my body, a living sacrifice
All I'm gonna do is the will of Christ
I was asked this question and the answer is yes

The question is when will Jesus return?
I want you to know soon, soon
Soon, soon, soon, soon

Look at the crisis in Iran
Russia's already invaded Afghanistan
Soon, soon, soon, soon, soon, soon

Oh, but I can hardly wait for Jesus to return
For His returning my heart of yearn
I was asked this question and the answer is real soon

Now the questions are will I ever leave You
Will I do Your will and when will Jesus return?
No and yes and soon, soon, soon, soon

Will I ever leave You, will I do Your will
When will Jesus return
And the answer is no and yes and soon, soon, soon, soon

Oh, if you've questioned when Christ is coming
The answer is soon
