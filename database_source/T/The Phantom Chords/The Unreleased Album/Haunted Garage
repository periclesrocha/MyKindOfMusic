Late at night I arrive
To get a glimpse of you
But I know my eyes will be empty
Every time, and it's true
You're just a ghost from a haunted garage

I hit a curb â€” too fast
I nearly lose my nerve
'cause my eyes observe a girl
But she's just somebody else
You're just a ghost from a haunted garage (haunted garage)

My engine screams
Red hot!
Like a tortured anguished cry
But I know
The sound, it will reach you

Still I have to cry (just a ghost)
Still I have to cry (just a ghost)
Still I have to cry (just a ghost)

Haunted garage
Haunted garage

Haunted
Haunted
Haunted garage
