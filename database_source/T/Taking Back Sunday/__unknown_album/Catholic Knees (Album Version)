Dusting off the all night from my catholic knees
I scraped them up good
(Scraped them up good)
I scraped them up good
You doctored them clean

Oh yes, we are patient, patient
Salt-licked wounds merely bruised
(But none of that'll matter)
None of that'll matter soon
On some ancient date, see how much you can take
None of that'll matter
None of that'll matter

Everything was moving so fast
(Everything was moving so fast)
Everything was moving so fast
(Everything was moving...)

Before my hands had the chance to grow
All I was told
"Good enough's as good as it's gonna get"
Yeah "good enough's as good as you'll ever get"

S-s-s-s-s-s-so I, I made a conscious decision
Shake the skin I've been stuck in
Stretch my bones
Believe in nothing
I can't quite seem to catch my breath
(But I cannot forget)

But none of that'll matter soon
(None of that'll matter soon)
But, None of that'll matter soon
(None of that'll matter soon)
Lord, please keep my feet flat on the ground

Everything was moving so fast
(Everything was moving so fast)
Everything was moving so fast
(Everything was moving...)

But that's where you came in
Yeah, here we are
Yeah, here I am
That's where you came in
Now, here we are
Lord, please keep my feet flat on the ground
Lord, keep my feet flat on the ground

Everything was moving so fast
(Everything was moving so fast)
Everything was moving so fast
(Everything was moving...)
