No one knows what it’s like
To be the bad man
To be the sad man
Behind blue eyes

No one knows what it’s like
To be hated
To be fated
To telling only lies

But my dreams
They aren’t as empty
As my conscience
Seems to be

I have hours
Only lonely
My love is vengeance
That’s never free

No one knows what it’s like
To feel these feelings
Like I do
And I blame you

No one bites back as hard
On their anger
None of my pain and woe
Can show through

But my dreams
They aren’t as empty
As my conscience
Seems to be

I have hours
Only lonely
My love is vengeance
That’s never free

When my fist clenches
Crack it open
Before I use it
And lose my cool

And when I smile
Tell me some bad news
Before I laugh
And act like a fool

And if I swallow
Anything evil
Put your finger
Down my throat

And if I shiver
Please give me a blanket
Keep me warm
Let me wear your coat

No one knows what it’s like
To be the bad man
To be the sad man
Behind blue eyes
