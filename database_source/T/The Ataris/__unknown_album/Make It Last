There's a lot on my mind so
I guess that I'll take it one thing at a time
still sometimes I can't help but wonder why...
I sit around all day and I waste my whole damn life away
still thinkin' bout' just what there is to say.

Should I say goodnight?
go to bed, turn out the fucking light
and leave you shining in the past.
Should I try and forget?
even though next week it's something I'll regret.
Or, should I try and make it last?

I think about the day when I felt you'd throw it all away
to try and make me feel like I'm the one.
You were my best friend
and I never ever thought those days would end
but now it seems like they are gone.

What more can I say?
I never wanted it to be this way,
and where the hell is yesterday?
We sure had a blast!
I'm sorry that we're living in the past
should we try and make it last?
