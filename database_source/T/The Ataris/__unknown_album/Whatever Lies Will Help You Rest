While Kansas city sleeps
Cloaked in the twilight of this valley
At this church is lined with
Roadside poetry
I could to the most desolate seclusions
My blackest secrets still imprison me
And why don't we say what we really feel?

Whenever things are at their best...
Whatever lies will help you rest
Whenever things are at their best...
Why do we wait for it to fall apart?
Fall apart

Waking to the after-taste
Of cheap wine and bad decisions
My heart trembles in this morning glare
I could shield my eyes
From these inner most seductions
But still somehow you'll find me there
And why don't we say what we really feel?

Whenever things are at their best...
Whatever lies will help you rest
Whenever things are at their best...
Why do we wait for it to fall apart?

And it's probably safe to say
I'm not the world safest bet
I've never been too good at being good
And its probably safe to say...

Whenever things are at their best...
Whatever lies will help you rest
Whenever things are at their best...
Why do we wait for it to fall apart?

Whenever things are at their best...
Whatever lies will help you rest
Whenever things are at their best...
Why do we wait for it to fall apart?
