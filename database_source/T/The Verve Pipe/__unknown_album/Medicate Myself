I hear you cryin' for me
But I see the anger in your eyes
I want what will not judge me
I need what keeps me warm inside

A man without a purpose
Stares from the mirror on the wall
You think you know my problems
I think that you don't know my at all

I don't believe I suffer
Disease as you proclaim
And I don't believe that I should kneel and hang my head in shame

Held prisoner by a monkey
Strapped on behind my back
And while I sit ablaze
The light is slowly fading into the black
So I

I've got to medicate myself again
I've got to medicate myself again
I've got to medicate myself again

Cause you don't need me hanging 'round
One more drink and I will be drowned

I know you hate to see me
As I defeat myself this way
You know you can't control me
You know I'm slipping day by day

Down into my obsession
Down in the hole where I belong
And when this fight is over
You will stay right here and I will be gone
So I

I've got to medicate myself again 3x

I found you broken
And lying on the floor
An empty bottle in the drain
I put my hand right through the kitchen door

I've got to medicate myself again
Cause you don't need me hanging 'round
I barely get my coat off and you're already
Crawling down my back again
Yeah you get to watch me sinking down
One more drink and I will be drowned

I've got to medicate myself again
