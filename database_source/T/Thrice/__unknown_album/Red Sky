I know what lies beneath
I've seen the flash of teeth
Conspiring with the reef
To sink our ship

The wind's a cheating wife
Her tongue a thirsty knife
And she could take your life
With one good kiss

Can you see the sky turn red
As morning's light breaks over me?
Know tonight we'll make our bed
At the bottom of the sea

I know the ocean speaks (The stars retreat behind their veil)
I've heard her call to me (The clouds are clinging to your sail)
And smiling in my dreams (The storm is coming, can you see?)
She whispers this:

"Can you see the sky turn red
As morning's light breaks over me?
Know tonight we'll make our bed
At the bottom of the sea"

Look and see the sky turn red
Like blood it covers over me
And soon the sea shall give up her dead
We'll raise an empire from the bottom of the sea.
