Where you're headed there is no return
You're hell bent on a crash and burn
You think you're winnin but you won't be free
Until you realize there's no enemy

So live
Live on through me
It's time to forgive
The creeper kamikaze

Goin down on a one way flight
You're just dyin to be right
Your time is closing in and that's a sign
Of moving forward on a slow decline

So live
Live on through me
It's time to forgive
The creeper kamikaze

And give
Give yourself to me
And everything you believe
Well it's the creeper kamikaze

So forgive
The things you cannot hide
Cause when the truth comes in
Your soul opens wide

So live
Live on through me
It's time to forgive
The creeper kamikaze

So forgive
So forgive
So forgive
So forgive
