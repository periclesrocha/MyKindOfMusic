The city lights, the pretty lights
They can warm the coldest nights
All the people going places
Smiling with electric faces
What they find, the glow erases
And what they lose, the glow replaces

And life is love
In a neon rainbow
A neon rainbow

Moving lines, flashing signs
Blinking faster than the minds
Leading people with suggestions
Leaving no unanswered questions
You can live without direction
And it don't have to be perfection

And life is love
In a neon rainbow
A neon rainbow

But in the daytime, everything changes
Nothing remains the same
No one smiles anymore
And no one will open his door until the night time comes

And then the city lights, the pretty lights
They can warm the coldest nights
All the people going places
Smiling with the electric faces
What they find, the glow erases
And what they lose, the glow replaces

And life is love
In a neon rainbow
A neon rainbow
A neon rainbow
