Rip them down
Hold me up
Tell them that
I'm your gun
Pull my trigger
I am bigger than-

Mr. Prez in his big White House
Listen, he says, we're comin' out
Infiltration - we're numbin' your minds
Concentration - we've done time

Rip them down
Hold me up
Tell them that
I'm your gun
Pull my trigger
I am bigger than-

Over there, the Queen, she says
Let's stamp them out and dry those tears
Saturation - we want in taxes
Flagellation - we've got gashes

Rip them down
Hold me up
Tell them that
I'm your gun
Pull my trigger
I am bigger than-

In the cold, the czar's claimin'
Just protectin', rockets aimin'
Alteration - earth is changin'
Observation - we want action

Rip them down
Hold me up
Tell them that
I'm your gun
Pull my trigger
I am bigger than-

I, the Emperor, proclaim
Us, the masters, we rule the game
Inclination - somethin' to dream on
Deprivation - we are sons

Rip them down
Hold me up
Tell them that
I'm your gun
Pull my trigger
I am bigger than-
