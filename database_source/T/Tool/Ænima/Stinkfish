Something has to change
Undeniable dilemma
Boredom’s not a burden
Anyone should bear

Constant overstimulation numbs me
But I would not want you any other way

Just not enough
I need more
Nothing seems to satisfy
I said I don’t want it
I just need it
To breathe, to feel, to know I’m alive

Finger deep within the borderline
Show me that you love me and that we belong together
Relax, turn around and take my hand

I can help you change
Tired moments into pleasure
Say the word and we’ll be
Well upon our way
Blend and balance
Pain and comfort deep within you
’Til you will not want me any other way

But not enough
I need more
Nothing seems to satisfy
I said I don’t want it
I just need it
To breathe, to feel, to know I’m alive

Knuckle deep inside the borderline
This may hurt a little but it’s something you’ll get used to
Relax, slip away

(Chupa minha piça bicha)
(Chupa minha piça)
(Chupa minha piça puta)

Something kinda sad about
The way that things have come to be
Desensitized to everything
What became of subtlety…

How can this mean anything to me
If I really don’t feel anything at all?
Yea

I’ll keep digging
’Til I feel something

Elbow deep inside the borderline
Show me that you love me and that we belong together
Shoulder deep within the borderline
Relax, turn around and take my hand
