I’m sweating, and breathing,
And staring, and thinking,
Sinking deeper.
And it’s almost like I’m swimming.

The sun is burning hot again
On the hunter and the fisherman,
And I’m trying to remember when,
But it makes me dizzy.

Seems like I’ve been here before.
Seems so familiar.
Seems like I’m slipping
Into a dream within a dream.

Must be the way you whisper.

The sun is setting cool again.
I’m the thinker and the fisherman
And I’m trying to remember when
But it makes me dizzy.

And I’m sweating, and breathing,
And staring, and thinking,
Sinking deeper.
And it’s almost like I’m swimming.

Seems like I’ve been here before.
Seems so familiar.
Seems like I’m slipping
Into a dream within a dream.

It’s the way you whisper.

Drags me under,
It takes me home!

Seems like I’ve been here before.
Seems so familiar.
Seems like I’m slipping
Into a dream within a dream.

It’s the way you whisper.

Drags me under,
It takes me home.
