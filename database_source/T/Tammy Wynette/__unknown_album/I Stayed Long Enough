Accident'ly in your arms and that's all it took
Knowing how you want and need me with just one look
To leave you now is something you should know that I can't do
I stayed long enough to fall in love with you
Long enough to know that what I feel won't go away
Just lookin' won't be near enough after today
Everything I need is everything I see in you
I stayed long enough to fall in love with you
[ steel ]
Yes everything I need...
I stayed just long enough to fall in love with you
