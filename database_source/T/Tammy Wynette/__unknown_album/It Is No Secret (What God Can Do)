The chimes of time ring out the news another day is through
Someone slipped and fell was that someone you
You may have long for added strenght your courage to renew
Do not be dishearteded for I bring hope to you
It is no secret what God can do what he's done for others he'll do for you
With arms wide open he'll pardon you it is no secret what God can do
With arms wide open he'll pardon you it is no secret what God can do
