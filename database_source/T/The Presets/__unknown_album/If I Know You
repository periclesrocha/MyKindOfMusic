Clever liar
Foolin' us all
Never thought I'd work it out
How could I have known it was ever about ya boy?

Now there's nothin' to say
'Cause there's no words
And we're not talkin' anyhow
You must have known I was never to doubt ya boy

If it was so fine, it was so good
Oh, you're unbelievable
All this time I've been livin' without ya boy
But not your lyin'

It felt so good, the world don't know
Now they'll never find out
How all these years she mustered beside ya boy
Don't forget that I

Was the one that ya found
And if I know you
You'll find me someplace new
I hope I never, I hope I never have to

We're a waste of time
And if I know you
Learned long ago it's true
I hope I never, I hope I never have to

Go and explain, explain it again
Boy, that this all started
Found you lying in the arms of another girl
So stop your crying

Day after day, year after year
Far too long it lasted
You must have thought I was nothing without ya boy
Don't forget that I

Was the one that ya found
And if I know you
You'll find me someplace new
I hope I never, I hope I never have to

We're a waste of time
And if I know you
Learned long ago it's true
I hope I never, I hope I never have to

And tonight, if we learn
That the world's on fire
I guess I'll turn to you
I hope I never, I hope I never have to

I fail to find
So hard to find
And I can't find a way for you and I to go further on

I'm always learning things the hard, hard, hardest way

'Cause I was the one, that ya found
And if I know you
You'll find me someplace new
I hope you never, I hope you never get to

Tonight, if we learn
That the world's on fire
I guess I'll turn to you
I hope I never, I hope I never have to
