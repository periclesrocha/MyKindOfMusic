Baby buy an Anaconda, baby buy a thing to wear
She go walking, she go crawling, she go sliding through the air
She goes talking warm and fashion, she goes talking debonair
But, see her face turns to a mask and passion turns to she don’t care

She will, she will, she will, she will let it take her breath away
She will, she will, she will, she will let it take her life away
Let it wrap itself around her ’til it kill her in its way
She will, she will, she will, she will blow away

Baby hit the rush hour traffic, get a ride to anywhere
Baby buy the number three, she pay the man, she pay the fare
Baby hit the wild blue yonder, on the mainline, on the side
Steal to feed the Anaconda, will not see the suicide

She will, she will, she will, she will let it take her breath away
She will, she will, she will, she will let it take her life away
Let it wrap itself around her ’til it kill her in its way
She will, she will, she will, she will blow away

Baby finger on the trigger, baby shoot formaldehyde
Turn into a marble figures, turn the matter dead inside
Turn into a China doll, go maybe to the final ride
Baby go where I don’t follow, baby to the other side

She will, she will, she will, she will let it take her breath away
She will, she will, she will, she will let it take her life away
Let it wrap itself around her ’til it kill her in its way
She will, she will, she will, she will blow away
