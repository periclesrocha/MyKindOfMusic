Oh Nubia Nubia Nubia, the word is love to me
Your beauty and the gentle magic of your soul live here in my memory
Golden evenings in pink white veils
Sounds of the river telling ancient tales
Dreams return me to you,
Fire flows in deep blue

Oh Nubia Nubia Nubia, the ringing in my ear
As I wander through another life in search of someone soft and sweet I once held near
Time glances the other way,
Life’s sweet shadow makes night his day
Brings me closer to you,
Paints my heart a deep blue

Whispers of eternity
Bridges life’s sweet mystery
To sleep I go and hear the name
Nubia Nubia Nubia Nubia...

Soft heart wait another day,
Flaming boat will take you away
Then at the mystery’s end,
I won’t have to pretend, 'tend, 'tend

Now, you are at the journey's end, now
All kind of gold at rainbow's end, now
Now, you are at the journey's end, now (hear)
All kind of gold at rainbow's end, now (hear)
Now, you are at the journey's end, now (not gonna search, search, search any longer, I'm not gonna search, search, search any longer)
All kind of gold at rainbow's end, now (not gonna search, search, search any longer, I'm not gonna search, search, search any longer)
Now, you are at the journey's end, now (not gonna search, search, search, I'm not gonna search, search, search )
All kind of gold at rainbow's end, now (not gonna search, search, search, I'm not gonna search, search, search)
I'm not gonna search, search, search any longer
