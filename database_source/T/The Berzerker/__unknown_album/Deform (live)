Degradation, i don't want your,
rhinoplasty, i don't need you,
not any more,
though i am a perverted man,
disproportioned, version of a,
normal man, dirty man,
any surgery can not get the god dam filth out of my head,
Maladjusted, not because of,
my appearance, you can't see past,
how i was born, are you blinded by the way you live?
violated, version of a,
normal man, dirty man,
reconstruction, reformation, reaching out into a shallow world,
My normal features, they gaze with impunity,
i am an animal, don't want to be a man,
i wish destruction on every man i see,
am i a man, am i a man, am i?
to forgive them means loss of my memory,
can i decide between a psycho and a citizen,
no chance of that i want death to my enemy,
i'm not a man, i'm not a man,
How can you think of me? judge of me? watch me?
all i want to be is, is to be free,
Degradation, i don't want your,
rhinoplasty, i don't need you,
though i am a perverted man,
disproportioned, version of a,
normal man, dirty man,
any surgery can not get the god dam filth out of my head.
