The day breaks your battered heart.
The sun rips your world apart.
And we will see it fall.

Live each day as it is your last.
A life lost in a photograph.
And we will join them all.

We are all falling snow.
So settle down, just settle down.
And I will slow your fall.
That is all. That is all.

We are all falling snow.
So settle down, just settle down.
And in amongst them all.
The Little Man stands tall.
