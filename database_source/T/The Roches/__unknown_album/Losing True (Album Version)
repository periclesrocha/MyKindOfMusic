(by Margaret A. Roche)


I'm losin' you
fading from view

aging and aching and raging and faking I'm

losin' you
losin' true

last time I saw you I wanted to paw you
not to destroy you now I just annoy you I'm

losin' to
accusin' you

when I first met you I failed to get you
now that I let you come through I forget who I'm

losin' out
cruisin' about

the night of shining armor doesn't do her any favors

make no mistake when mystiquing a make I'm

losin' you
choosin' to
