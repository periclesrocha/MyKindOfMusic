Midnite, you know you’re doing me wrong
Keeping me up all night long
Everytime I feel a little bit free
I hear those blues, midnite blues
Commence to calling me

Midnite, why don’t you leave me alone?
I’m trying my best to make a happy home
Everytime I feel a little bit free
I hear those blues, midnite blues
Commence to calling me

I just can’t help to feel a little bit ashamed
Everytime I hear you calling my name
Blaming you for all the bad things I’ve done
Still I will admit that every once in a while it was fun, oh yeah

Midnite, don’t keep me running around
I made up my mind, I’m gonna settle down
Everytime I feel a little bit free
I hear those blues, midnite blues
Blues, midnite blues
I hear those blues, midnite blues
Commence to calling me
