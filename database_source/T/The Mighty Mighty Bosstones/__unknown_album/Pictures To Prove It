Well you insisted the day you walked away
That we shared nothing, but I've got something
That I'd still like to say
You're not here to listen, and we were never good at that
Let's set the record straight, we shared something great
Even though now nothing's where we're at

Pictures to prove it, I've got the proof
When you hit the bricks, I hit the roof
I hit the bottle, put the pictures on the bar
I'll always have these pictures, but I don't know where you are
And I've got pictures to prove it
If you saw them, I'm sure
You'd be forced to remember
What we don't have anymore
I've got a pile of pictures
I've got a whole stack of proof
I've got pictures to prove it, I've got, I've got

Pictures to prove it,
Smudged with fingerprints and tears
Cigarette ashes
And our first few happy years
They're old now, they're faded
And the edges all are frayed
I'll always have these pictures
But I wish that you had stayed

I've got pictures to prove it
If you saw them, I'm sure
You'd be forced to remember
What we don't have anymore
I've got a pile of pictures
I've got a whole stack of proof
I've got pictures to prove it and all I ever do is

Stare at the pictures for hours on end
They tell the truth to me
While I'm sure you just pretend
And you deny we ever happened and swear it never was that way
Even you'll admit when I submit to you exhibit A

Right?

I've got pictures to prove it
I'm not just blowing smoke
If you don't believe me, believe them
No this ain't no joke
I've got a pile of pictures
I've got a whole stack of proof
Someone look at the pictures
I've got, I've got...
