I hate the treadmill every day
I hate the mundane things they say
The boredom sets in 9 to 5
At night that’s when I come alive

I long to be connected
I long to be affected
The bright lights beckon me
Beckon me to you

I like it when we go to extremes
I like it when you enter my dreams
I like it when I feel your touch
I like it… I like it so much

There must be more to life than this
This life I surely will not miss
To spend my time waiting in line
In search for something — the grand design

I long to be connected
I long to be affected
The bright lights beckon me
Beckon me to you

I like it when we go to extremes
I like it when you enter my dreams
I like it when I feel your touch
I like it… I like it so much

I like it when we’re one-on-one
I like it when we come undone
I like it when we go to extremes
So let me, let me live my dreams

(Oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh)
So much…

I long to be connected
I long to be affected
The bright lights beckon me
Beckon me to you

I like it when we go to extremes
I like it when you enter my dreams
I like it when I feel your touch
I like it… I like it so much

I like it when we’re one-on-one
I like it when we come undone
I like it when we go to extremes
So let me, let me live my dreams

I like it so much

I like it so much

I like it so much
