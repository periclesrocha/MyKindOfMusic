He was old and he walked slowly through the park
To the bench where he would sleep on after dark
He saw a bird high on a tree
And said listen carefully
So your life will not end in misery

Don't fly too high, my little bird
'Cause if you try you may get hurt
You will burn your wings
When you reach for the sun
Don't fly too high, my little bird
Your lonely cry won't be heard
You'll be tumbling down to the ground
'Cause pride will have a fall

Then the little bird came flying from the tree
And it landed lightly on the old man's knee
Just a tiny piece of bread, 'twas all the old man had
But he gave it to the little bird and said

Don't fly too high, my little bird
'Cause if you try you may get hurt
You will burn your wings
When you reach for the sun
Don't fly too high, my little bird
Your lonely cry won't be heard
You'll be tumbling down to the ground
'Cause pride will have a fall

Then one morning the old man went to the highway
All the cars he tried to stop were passing by
So he could not save his friend
Who was dying in his hands
Because his broken wings would never mend
Don't fly too high, my little bird
'Cause if you try you may get hurt
You will burn your wings
When you reach for the sun
Don't fly too high, my little bird
Your lonely cry won't be heard
You'll be tumbling down to the ground
'Cause pride will have a fall
