Just like a flower when winter begins
Just like a candle blown out in the wind
Just like a bird that can no longer float
I’m feeling that way sometimes
But then as I’m falling weighed down by the load
I picture a light at the end of the road
and closing my eyes I can see through the dark
the dream that is in my heart

A little loving, a little giving
to build a dream for the world we live in
a little patience and understanding
for our tomorrow, a little peace
a little sunshine, a sea of gladness
to wash away all the tears of sadness
a little hoping, a little praying
for our tomorrow, a little peace

I feel I’m a leaf in the November snow
I fell to the ground, there was no one below
So now I am helpless alone with my song
just wishing the storm was gone

A little loving, a little giving
to build a dream for the world we live in
a little patience and understanding
for our tomorrow, a little peace
a little sunshine, a sea of gladness
to wash away all the tears of sadness
a little hoping, a little praying
for our tomorrow, a little peace

We are feathers on the breeze
Sing with me my song of peace
We are feathers on the breeze
Sing with me my song of peace
