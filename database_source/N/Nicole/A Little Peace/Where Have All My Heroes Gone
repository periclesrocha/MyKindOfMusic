I remember when how we used to play
How we let our dreams take us far away
And when evening came and all the lights were turned down low
They told us tales of long ago

Where have all my heroes gone?
Cinderella and Peter Pan
All the stories of fairyland
Have they come to an end?

Where have all my heroes gone?
Good ol' Kermit and Superman
Were a part of my wonderland
And we'll always be friends

Childhood days are gone every now and then
I look back and wish they were here again
Growing up is fun although it hurts to realize
We sometimes leave those friends behind

Where have all my heroes gone?
Cinderella and Peter Pan
All the stories of fairyland
Have they come to an end?

Where have all my heroes gone?
Good ol' Kermit and Superman
Were a part of my wonderland
And we'll always be friends

Where have all my heroes gone
Precious friends that were dear to me
From the kingdom of fantasy
They just faded away

Where have all my heroes gone
Cinderella and Peter Pan
All the stories of fairyland
Have they come to an end?

Good ol' Kermit and Superman
Were a part of my wonderland
And we'll always be friends
And we'll always be friends
And we'll always be friends

Where have all my heroes gone?
Where have all my heroes gone?
