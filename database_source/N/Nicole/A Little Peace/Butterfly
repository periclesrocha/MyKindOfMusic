It was late one summer evening
when I saw that butterfly
On its wings were every colour
you could find

And I held it for a moment
then I let if fly away
Soon it disappeared
and left me far behind

And in my imagination
I was floating on the breeze
Drifting over every mountain,
sea and land

And with no one there to stop me
Every dream was coming true
People walking side by side,
and hand in hand

Butterfly, butterfly, butterfly
Spread your wings, like a bird, flying high
Set your sail, ride the wind
take the news around the world
Bringing love and happiness eternally

Butterfly, butterfly, butterfly
Fly away, like a star in the sky
Carry hope, carry faith
into every lonely heart
Teach the world to live in peace and harmony

In a dream I saw it flying
to a far and distant shore
Where the people stood
and watched it with a smile

Soon the quarreling was over
There was peace throughout the land
Making all the days of traveling
seem worthwhile

There were tulip fields in Holland
And the roses in Versailles
And the English country garden
in the sun

Edelweiss and bright red poppies
Lovely blue forget-me-nots
Growing tall and proud,
and shared by everyone

Butterfly, butterfly, butterfly
Spread your wings, like a bird, flying high
Set your sail, ride the wind
take the news around the world
Bringing love and happiness eternally

Butterfly, butterfly, butterfly
Fly away, like a star in the sky
Carry hope, carry faith
into every lonely heart
Teach the world to live in peace and harmony

Now and then there is danger all around
Thunder strikes and lightning hits the ground
But my friend shakes his wings and carries on
Through the rain to the sun

Butterfly, butterfly, butterfly
Spread your wings, like a bird, flying high
Set your sail, ride the wind
take the news around the world
Bringing love and happiness eternally

Butterfly, butterfly, butterfly
Fly away, like a star in the sky
Carry hope, carry faith
into every lonely heart
Teach the world to live in peace and harmony

And I wish that I could be up
there with you
and fly so free in the sky, butterfly… butterfly…
