And when I open my eyes I see the end of
An ending life I've forgotten how to live.
I keep forgetting, I keep rebuilding.
This is when I say I'm done.
I haven't learned.
No one will show me, so I go on my own.
Honestly, I'm so fucking pitiful.
Don't tell me what I've heard before.
Destined to walk another day alone.
This day is dying.
This day is fucking dead.
Just shine my way back home.
You can stay if you find comfort.
Don't speak.
Just breathe instead.
Just don't leave me alone.
I don't just need it, I deserve it.
I want what I promised myself.
I want what you promised us all.
I'm coming to terms.
This is the end of denial.
Sometimes things just fall apart.
Angels laugh above me and demons wait below.
I'm naked, bare, and broken, ready to go home.
Now I need you more than ever.
And when heaven overlooks me I'll need you there to pick me back up
