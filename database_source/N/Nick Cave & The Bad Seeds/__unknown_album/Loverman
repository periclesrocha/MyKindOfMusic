There's a devil waiting outside your door (How much longer)
Bucking and braying and paywing the floor
Well, he's howling with pain and crawling up the walls
There's a devil waiting outside your door
He's weak with evil and broken by the world
He's shouting your name and asking for more
There's a devil waiting outside your door

Lover man! Since the world began
Forever, Amen Till the end of time
Take off that dress I'm coming down
I'm your loverman
Cause I am what I am what I am what I am

L is for LOVE baby
O is for ONLY you that I do
V is for loving VIRTUALLY everything you are
E is for loving almost EVERYTHING that you do
R is for RAPE me
M is for MURDER me
A is for ANSWERING all of my pryers
N is for KNOWING your loverman's going to be the answer to all of yours

I'll be your Loverman! Till the bitter end
While empires burn down
Forever and ever and ever and ever Amen
I'm your Loverman
So help me, baby So help me
Cause I am what I am what I am
I'm your Loverman!

There's a devil crawling along your floor
With a trembling heart,
He's coming through your door
With his straining sex in his jumping paw
There'a a devil crawling along your floor
And he's old and he's stupid and he's hungry and he's sore
And he's blind and he's lame and he's dirty and he's poor
There's a devil crawling along your floor

Loverman! Here I stand Forever, Amen
Cause I am what I am what I am what I am
Forgive me, baby My hands are tied
And I got no choice No, I got no choice at all

I'll say it again

L is for LOVE, baby
O is for O yes I do
V is for VIRTUE, so I ain't gonna hurt you
E is for EVEN if you want me to
R is for RENDER unto me, baby
M is for that which is MINE
A is for ANY old how, darling
N is for ANY old time

I'll be your Loverman! I got a masterplan
To take off your dress And be your man
Seize the throne Seize the mantle
Seize the crown Cause I am what I am what I am what I am
I'm your Loverman!

There's a devil lying by your side
You might think he's asleep
But take a look at his eyes
He wants you, darling, to be his bride
There's a devil lying by your side
