There's no song for the singer
No words for the tune
There's a mess in the message
And a man on the moon
There's no plan in the planet
It's all gone berserk
There's a milk bottle shortage
And the traffic lights don't work

Lie down and be counted
Don't take any more
Lie down and be counted
What are we standing for?

But there's hope for the couples who stroll in the park
There's nuclear power to light up the dark
There's national health and ice in the fridge
And the occasional cow on a motorway bridge
There's extended credit on easier terms
And something to kill all known household germs
There's sofas and armchairs and washing machines
Stars on Sunday, fish fingers and beans

Lie down and be counted
Don't take any more
Lie down and be counted
What are we standing for?

There's no song for the singer, no words for the tune
There's a mess in the message and a man on the moon
There's no plan in the planet, it's all gone berserk
There's an everything shortage and the traffic lights still don't work

Lie down and be counted
Don't take any more
Lie down and be counted
What are we standing for?

Lie down and be counted
Don't take any more
Lie down and be counted
What are we standing for?
