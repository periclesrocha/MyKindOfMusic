We're in the building where they make us grow
And I'm frightened by the liquid engineers
Like you

My mallory heart
Is sure to fail
I could crawl around the floor
Just like I'm real
Like you

The sound of metal
I want to be
You
I should learn to be man
Like you

Plug me in
And turn me on
Oh everything is moving here

I need my treatment
It's tomorrow they send me
Singing "I am an American"
Do you?

Picture this
If I should make the change
I'd love to pull the wires from the wall!
Did you?

And who are you?
And how can I try?
Here inside I like the metal
Don't you?

All I know, is no one dies
I'm still confusing love with need
