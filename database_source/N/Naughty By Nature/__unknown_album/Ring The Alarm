(Chorus x2)
Ring the alarm
Jersey bring the bitch out the bastards
Woah yeah
We get cash in wit bass D.O.A.
You'll find that higher Brick City D.O.A.

(Verse 1)
It just ain't yo time yet, and you still claimin rhyme vet
Criticise us when yo bitch ass ain't even signed yet
Instincts is mental, some bitch stinkin gentle
Go reshine yo symbol and rethink yo demo
If fifth was a fifth we'd both be drunk
And if it hurt my shit he'd be dead in the trunk
Fuck the funk, pass the puck
And parade on Upper Lassgate
The charge in the city is still perform for Petacky
In that case it must be Naughty for life
Shout out to all my niggas doin 20 to life
I trust fools about as far as I can see you tricks
So fuck you wit 2, think quick I don't need you jinx (Ha!)

CHORUS x2 (Replace Jersey with Westside on repeat)

(Verse 2)
Spoke the mic and let you kiss of death
Smokin MCs before they have a chance to take one breath
I got the shit to blow right through yo vest
Any nigga thinkin they wanna step 2 this, jump and test
Naughty's been known for bringin major niggas max of stress
Never want us in yo party cos we crack yo set
Little juvenile delinquent gets a classic vet
Somebody come and grab yo child before I snap his neck
Uuh! Yeah! You motherfuckers disgrace me
I'll make money but the money don't make me
Niggas like you be always actin so flakey
Chess while you runnin round yo hood, don't shake ya
Crowd puts it down on the level above
It's international called Illtown love
Witness this motherfucker just turn the mic on
I spit this shit from my bitches who get they dyke on, rap pawns

CHORUS x2 (Replace Jersey with Midwest on repeat)

(Verse 3)
Jerry taps some more caps, ooh where you goin
Reapin in somebody half six in the mornin
Whoo, and the rollin deep with they gat in they hand
With they wars canine, and they batterin rams
Somebody that got them mad
Bitch rollin through the front fence, strollin through my back
If Vin move the llello, continue to lay low
You try to fuck me now you've been doe rubbin day hoe
Could've been on the payroll, but you wanna play bro
So muthafuck you and tell the captain I say so
I'll show you the master you dick writin bastard
My lawyer's so good, she gonna be workin in Alaska

CHORUS x2 (Replace Jersey with Eastside on repeat)
