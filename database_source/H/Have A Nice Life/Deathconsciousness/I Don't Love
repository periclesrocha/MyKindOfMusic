I don’t want to live like this, Lord
I don’t want to live at all
I don’t want to make this face anymore
But if I don’t, that’s all

I don’t want to live like this anymore
I don’t want to live at all
I don’t want to make this face anymore
But if I don’t, that’s all

I don’t love
I don’t feel anything
I don’t feel anything where this love should be

I don’t want to feel this anymore
But if I don’t, that’s fake
I don’t want to do this anymore
But there’s nothing else to take

I don’t love
I don’t feel anything
I don’t feel anything where this love should be

I don’t love
I don’t feel anything
I don’t feel anything where this love should be

I don’t love
I don’t feel anything
I don’t feel anything where this love should be

I don’t love
I don’t feel anything
I don’t feel anything where this love should be

I don’t love
I don’t feel anything
I don’t feel anything where this love should be
