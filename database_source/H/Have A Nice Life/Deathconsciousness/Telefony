If science is half the man it says it is
Then I can build it
The machine that snaps
All of time in half
I can break its back
I can break its back

I can build a door
And I can travel through
They do it with telefony
You don’t see it much anymore, but
But surely I
But surely I
If I could just hear your voice
If I could just hear your voice
But I don’t think I have the choice

The look on your face
When I first connect the line
For the very first time
My words come slowly to mind
“Is anybody there?”
All trembling and scared
Replies then come
Fainter than air

“When the world hates a body, it just throws itself away to a place where our hands can’t reach.”
