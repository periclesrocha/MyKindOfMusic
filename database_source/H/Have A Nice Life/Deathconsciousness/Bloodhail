I feel the top of the roof come off
Kill everybody there
And I’m watching all the stars burn out
Trying to pretend that I care

But I didn’t, no-one ever does
And I would, no-one ever will
Can’t you see it’s all flown out of my hands
And our clothes are all too often ripped
And our teeth are all too often gnashed
And it lasts as long as it possibly can

But I just don’t
But I just don’t accept this
I just don’t accept this at all
But I just don’t
But I just don’t accept this
I just don’t accept this at all
But I just don’t
But I just don’t accept this
I just don’t accept this at all
But I just don’t
But I just don’t accept this
I just don’t accept this at all

Faces sweaty, arms and legs
What a glorious set of stairs we make
Faces sweaty, arms and legs
What a glorious set of stairs we make
Faces sweaty, arms and legs
What a glorious set of stairs we make

We kill everyone with
Arrowheads, arrowheads, arrowheads, arrowheads
Arrowheads, arrowheads, arrowheads, arrowheads
Arrowheads, arrowheads, arrowheads, arrowheads
Arrowheads, arrowheads, arrowheads, arrowheads

Thank god that’s over
(Arrowheads, arrowheads, arrowheads, arrowheads)
Thank god that’s over
(Arrowheads, arrowheads, arrowheads, arrowheads)
Thank god that’s over
(Arrowheads, arrowheads, arrowheads, arrowheads)
Thank god that’s over
(Arrowheads, arrowheads, arrowheads, arrowheads)
Thank god that’s over
(Arrowheads, arrowheads, arrowheads, arrowheads)
Thank god that’s over
(Arrowheads, arrowheads, arrowheads, arrowheads)
Thank god that’s over
(Arrowheads, arrowheads, arrowheads, arrowheads)
Thank god that’s over
(Arrowheads, arrowheads, arrowheads, arrowheads)

(Thank god that’s over)
I feel the top of the roof come off
Kill everybody there
(Arrowheads, arrowheads, arrowheads, arrowheads)
(Thank god that’s over)
(Arrowheads, arrowheads, arrowheads, arrowheads)
(Thank god that’s over)
As I’m watching all the stars burn out
Trying to pretend that I care
(Arrowheads, arrowheads, arrowheads, arrowheads)

(Thank god that’s over)
But I didn’t, no-one ever does
And I would, no-one ever will
Can’t you see its all flown out of my hands
(Arrowheads, arrowheads, arrowheads, arrowheads)
(Thank god that’s over)
And our clothes are all too often ripped
And our teeth are all too often gnashed
(Arrowheads, arrowheads, arrowheads, arrowheads)
And it lasts as long as it possibly can
