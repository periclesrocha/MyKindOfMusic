God of the past
I lied to myself
If we’re to fall
What can I do?
Not of the flesh
Alive in my head
Where do we go?
I could be next

God of the past
Blind to my sins
Billions before
Billions of years
Born of the flesh
Caught in myself
I want her back
I wanna know the purpose

We can’t go back
No one can
Somehow we
Believe we will
We can’t go back
No one has
It’s over now
We never will
