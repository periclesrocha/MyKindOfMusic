And though we know how far we’ve come
We stay possessed by what we lost
And we both know, love’s not in our hearts
And we both know, love’s not in our hearts
And we both know, love’s not in our hearts
And we both know, love’s not in our hearts

Not in our hearts

We’re never going backwards
We’re never growing young (not in our hearts)
We’re never coming back here
Remember, love’s not in our hearts

Are we all the same, different?
Promise you, the fire’s hot
Are we all the same, different?
Promised you to promise more

And though we know how far we’ve grown
We know it’s not in our hearts
We stay possessed by what we lost
No, not in our hearts

We’re never going backwards
We’re never growing young (not in our hearts)
We’re never coming back here
Remember, what you are
We’re never going backwards (not in our hearts)
We’re never growing young (not in our hearts)
We’re never coming back here (not in our hearts)
Remember, love’s not in our hearts
