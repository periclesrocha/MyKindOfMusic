Love, save us once
We’ll fall from where we crawled
Love, save us once
Beware what you want

Trust us now
It’s time to let me go
Give up on us
Follow what you want
Trust us now
It’s time to let me go
Give up
Give our soul away

Now you will go
Save us once
We’ll never let go
Where we crawled
The memories are wrong
Save us once
You’ll never wake up
What you thought you want

Trust us now
It’s time to let me go
Give up for now
Follow what you want
Trust us now
It’s time to let me go
Give up
Give our soul away

Remember with love
It’s time to let me never let go
Follow in your memories alone
It’s time to let me never let go
We die alone
