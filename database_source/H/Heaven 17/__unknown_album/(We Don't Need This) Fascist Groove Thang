Have you heard it on the news
About this fascist groove thang?
Evil men with racist views
Spreading all across the land
Don't just sit there on your ass
Unlock that funky chaindance
Brothers, sisters, shoot your best
We don't need this fascist groove thang

Brothers, sisters
We don't need this
Brothers, sisters
We don't need the fascist groove thang

History will repeat itself
Crisis point, we're near the hour
Counterforce will do no good
Hot you ass, I feel your power
Hitler proves that funky stuff
It's not for you and me, girl
Europe's an unhappy land
They've had their fascist groove thang

Brothers, sisters
We don't need their fascist groove thang
Brothers, sisters
We don't need their fascist groove thang

Democrats are out of power
Across that great wide ocean
Reagan's president elect
Fascist God in motion
Generals tell him what to do
Stop your good time dancing
Train their guns on me and you
Fascist thang advancing

Sisters, brothers lend a hand
Increase your population
Grab that groove thang by the throat
And throw it in the ocean

You're real tonight, you move my soul
Let's cruise out of the dance war
Come out your house and dance your dance
Shake that fascist groove thang

Brothers, sisters
We don't need that fascist groove thang
Brothers, sisters
We don't need the fascist groove thang

Brothers, sisters
We don't need their fascist groove thang
Brothers, sisters
We don't need that fascist groove thang

Brothers, sisters
We don't need their fascist groove thang
Brothers, sisters
We don't need their fascist groove thang

Brothers, sisters
We don't need their fascist groove thang
Brothers, sisters
We don't need their fascist groove thang

Brothers, sisters
We don't need their fascist groove thang
Brothers, sisters
We don't need their fascist groove thang

Brothers, sisters
We don't need their fascist groove thang
Brothers, sisters
We don't need their fascist groove thang

Brothers, sisters
We don't need their fascist groove thang
Brothers, sisters
We don't need their fascist groove thang

Brothers, sisters
We don't need their fascist groove thang
Brothers, sisters
We don't need their fascist groove thang

Brothers, sisters
We don't need their fascist groove thang
