I was so blind.
I couldn't see the truth.
I was unable to see how my life was being used.
To be something so miniscule.
Everything i thought was so definite,
I thought was so real was thrown away and will be remembered among unpaling hatred.

Consider my suffering.
Through all your pain.
Remember my face.
I'm digging your grave.
Since when was so sacred,
turning into something so wrong.
something so important to me.
Cheapened and exploited.
I won't be that way, I can't, I can't be that way again.
I can't, I won't, I will never let it.
[repeat chorus]
For the rest of your fucking
life you will mark my words.
