Some of us have had their faithful day,
When harmony fades and life stands still,
Those who are willing to sacrafice,
Were blessed with the instinct to survive.

This is for those who escaped the tourment,
You know real courage,
You are as diehard as they come.
This is for those who never wavered,
You are fearless,
You are as diehard as they come.

YOU! - ARE! - AS DIEHARD AS THEY COME!!! (x4)

Never waver, never falter,
Remain, DIEHARD!

YOU! - ARE! - AS DIEHARD AS THEY COME!!! (x2)
