We have been moving
To cuts and bruises
I'll sing a song for you
Run faster or you'll lose it
This is our heartbeat
Our words are so sweet
You dropped your medicine
Inside the water that we drink
Mama, tell me do I have a fever?

From the west I see the warrior sleep
And from the eat I watch the witches bathe my feet
I headed north and saw you dancing in the rain
I woke up in the south and I will never be the same
Mama, tell me do I have a fever?

I looked left to find your fingerprints were gone
I look right to something was going wrong
I looked up to see the sun had flickered out
I headed down the road that lead me to the south

Oh Lord, This road I travel
Has made my head unravel
I just want to go home
But this road won't let me go

Country road
Take me home
To the place
Where I belong
I'm so homesick
And I can't see straight
I'm not gonna make it
It's getting too late

Oh Lord, This road I travel
Has made my head unravel
I just want to go home
But this road won't let me go

We have been moving
To cuts and bruises
I'll sing a song for you
Run faster or you'll lose it
This is our heartbeat
Our words are so sweet
I cannot wake from you
You will not ever wake from me
