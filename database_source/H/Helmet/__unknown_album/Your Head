That's the logical explanation
Destruction might assume charge or feed belief
Passing time again, fun out on the street
That's still juvenile preoccupation

Standing buttholes, the line goes down the block
Familiarity is more convincing
Funds available erect the monument
Dead is dead I guess
What's the cost of a head?

That fills your head but you're good for that
