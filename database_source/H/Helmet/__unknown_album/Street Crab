First I'll panic quick and listen
To advice
Agree to anything and try to be
Too niceThen my skin flakes, another allergy
I'm not making sense, just
Ignore me

Thirst I had at last
Run the water
Shut my mouth and run past
What's the matter?
Street crabs buy in fast
Infect the water

Safe and sound like the perfect food
Ice the beer, it's easy to feel good
What was that you said? I thought
I heard my name but
Every street crab will push the
Vowels the same

Thirst I had at last
Run the water
Shut my mouth and run past
What's the matter?
Street crabs buy in fast
Infect the water
