I stood in the warmth of the light
Chilled to the bone
Hundreds of faces in sight
Still I was alone

Door after door
And room after empty room
I’ve stood here before
But under a different moon

In the longest days and the darkest nights
(I hear a voice that calls me, that calls me)
Down the longest road there’s a presence of light
(I hear a voice that calls me, that calls me)
I hear a voice that calls me
It’s love’s name I call
In the end

(I hear a voice that calls me, that calls me)
(I hear a voice that calls me, that calls me)

I’ve walked in and out of the fire
Between truth and lies
Now how many children watch
While one child cries

I’ll tear down these walls
And watch while their souls are freed
I’ll throw away pride
To drown in this endless sea

In the longest days and the darkest nights
(I hear a voice that calls me, that calls me)
Down the longest road there’s a presence of light
(I hear a voice that calls me, that calls me)
I hear a voice that calls me
It’s love’s name I call
In the end

Hundreds of tears on the water
Mercy come rain down on me

In the longest days and the darkest nights
(I hear a voice that calls me, that calls me)
Down the longest road there’s a presence of light
(I hear a voice that calls me, that calls me)
In the longest days and the darkest nights
Down the longest road there’s a presence of light
(I hear a voice that calls me, that calls me)
I hear a voice that calls me
It’s love’s name I call
In the end

Hundreds of tears on the water
Mercy come rain down on me
Hundreds of tears on the water
Mercy come rain down on me

Hundreds of tears on the water
Mercy come rain down on me
Hundreds of tears on the water
Mercy come rain down on me
