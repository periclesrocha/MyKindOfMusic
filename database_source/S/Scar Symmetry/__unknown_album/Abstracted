Darkness falls, light descending
From the sky and towards the ground

Electric presence
Prolonged strobe flash
Rays of light
Now shatters the night

Abstracted shape
Abstracted one
High voltage bolt was aimed at the head and chest

One taken
Lost to the skies
Gone, taken away
Five days absent
The manhunt fails
None can explain
The course of events

Abstracted shape
Abstracted one
High voltage bolt was aimed at the head and chest
Abducted soul
Abducted mind
Bright bolts of energy slays reality

Departure
Strange sights
Chaos within me
Departure
Bright lights
I can't believe my eyes

Electric presence
Prolonged strobe flash
Rays of light
Now shatters the night

Abstracted shape
Abstracted one
High voltage bolt was aimed at the head and chest
Abducted soul
Abducted mind
Bright bolts of energy slays reality

Departure
Strange sights
Chaos within me
Departure
Bright lights
I can't believe my eyes

Darkness falls, light descending
From the sky and towards the ground
