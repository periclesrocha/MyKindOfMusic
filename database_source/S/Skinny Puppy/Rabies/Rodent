[all the way down]
[bail out!]

(What came back to Earth was a great rock and roll band)

Level edge
Backs against the edge
No knives
The stone-hard eyes

Without the longing
Or fear that it will disappear
They cling on, nurturing
Neverending

Obsessions on the table
Lines needed
Walls cover, tips the balance
Don’t touch me!
Whipped out
Covering
It’s about the word money
Mouth the word money
Mouth the word money

Going to make some money
In god I will trust
Death behold persuasion
Won’t bust me up

Hey-ho!
Whatcha you doin’?
Don’t know
Round me up!

(What came back to Earth was a great rock and roll band)

Head shake, handshake
Out to get a long way
Form corrosion
Pushes closer to the edge
Wired, not connected

Peeling back
Plastic wrap
Tinted green
And all illusion
And all illusion
And all illusion
And all existing!

Catch up in crossfire
Trading tall tales
Where’re you going?
Where do you fail?
What’s that mean?
What’s that mean?
What’s that mean?

Back and forth
Side-by-side
Loose knot weave
Keep it up
Altogether
Or whatever that means

Passing underneath the trespass
Don’t get too close!
Don’t get too close!
Not worth your money!
Mouth the word your money!

(What came back to Earth was a great rock and roll band)

If I fade I may
And I wanna get away
All that I do is pray
That you will be there too
If this is trying
To deceive some minds
What the hell have you got to say?
Anyway

Under no dream hide an ugly secret

Altogether
Altogether

In this quiet place
Waiting for their trees
To rot

Time to stop
Time to stop
Time to stop

Money
Mouth the word money
Mouth the word money
Mouth the word money

(What came back to Earth was a great rock and roll band)
