[I want you]
[They will kill you]

Trip the long dusty road
Care denounce no overload
In as much as what’s become
A sterile cracked-up iceberg tomb
Mist on ash murky shore
Now, begin don’t let it show
Answers even, without feeling
No fulfilling close the door

Last call
Open bar
Never closing
Go beyond

Last call
A shallow pond
Slow descending
So slow to drown

Match the perfect DNA
Switch pretend at last to see
Cancellation is the fee
Respectfully to never be

Symbolized simile
Put in words so simply
Ask direction no correction
Map the course to end of way

(Hypocrisy)

[They will kill you]

Last call
Open bar
Slow descending
So reach beyond

Last call
A shallow pond
Slow descending
So slow to drown

(You make believe)

Last call
Open bar
Never closing
Reach beyond

Last call
Shallow pond
Slow descending
So slow to drown

Catch the stall wishful air
Walk among do seem to care
On the surface righteous air
Deliver on the right to share
Mesh the fine nucleic bond
Crawl between the chromosome
On the top of what’s bocome
A two-fold generation boom

Last call
Open bar
Slow descending
Reach beyond

Last call
A shallow pond
Slow descending
So slow to drown

[I want you]
[I want you]
[I want you]
[I want you]

[They will kill you]
