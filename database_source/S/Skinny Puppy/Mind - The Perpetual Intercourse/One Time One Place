Metal rain collapse crawls out
Which way the will go
Harness to ever last

Wallowing to test the past
A truth at times so shallow
Develop an attitude

More time, decay, lapse in
Fortify thyself, cut off
Inbred and forever more

What a way to end the game

(Third world visionary)
(Man will pretend)

[One time, one time one place]

Failing, bleeding eyes
Conjure the pain
Distant, so distant
Melting in the rain

Cold war
Flies forth on wings of destruction
An orgy of missile tests

Mortifying flash
Huddled round the radioactive
Console to control

The lives of the young
Levels of toxic waste
Disgraced
Yet tolerant

Of all that’s been done
Built up for a future race
A race that’s never won

[One time, one time one place]

Falling from the high
Meet the maker’s face
Distort, forget time
Forever leave this place

An atom fuse
Shortens with man’s progression
Decipher what’s relative

A legal bureaucrat
Motions with a tender finger
Whose poverties
And whose will be next

Man in a cave
Further action left at that
Two gaping holes
A dripping carnivore

Nature’s regret
The law of things so brutalized
An enemy that need not

What a way to end the game

[One time, one time one place]

Third world
Make peace
A visionary
Repress the weak
Repress the weak
Repress the weak
Repress the weak
Repress, repress

That’s all there is!

(That’s all there is)

(Ingrowing)

A hint of gleam
A halo of old jaded weakness
Corruption runs harmonious

Taken by the extremes
Doorway extinction pleases
Repression is based on love

For all length of time
Full of elemental powers [one time, one time one place]
Inbred and not brilliant
No fortune could buy this

(What a way to end the game)

(Forever)
