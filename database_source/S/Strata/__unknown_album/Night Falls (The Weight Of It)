The room filled up with water
And the roar of the crowd died down
They didn't hold their breath
They just waited to drown

Now, I'm the ghost in the corner
That nobody knows
I'm just a chill in the air that comes
And cuts you to the bone

I've never seen it shine so bright before
I stumble blind into the light of it all

The walls of this city are
All cold metal and stone
But we're nothing permanent:
We're just soft skin and bones

I'm just the pins and the
Needles attacking your toes
I'm just a message saved
In your phone a long, long time ago
Where I'm singing how...

I've never seen it shine so bright before
I stumbled blind into the light, the light of it all
You've never seen it shine, so hard beforeâ€”
You'd crumble underneath the weight, the weight of it all

I'm always with you
I never left you alone
