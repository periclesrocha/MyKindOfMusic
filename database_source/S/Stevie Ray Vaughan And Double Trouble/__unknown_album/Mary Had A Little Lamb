Mary had a little lamb,
It's fleece was white as snow, yeah.
Everywhere the child went,
The little lamb was sure to go, yeah.

He followed her to school one day,
And broke the teachers rule.
What a time did they have,
That day at school.

Tisket, tasket,
A green and yellow basket.
Sent a letter to my baby,
On my way I passed it.
