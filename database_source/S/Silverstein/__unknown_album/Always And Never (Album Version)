This took my fate, giving in
To your lips, To your Lies
You say that, that it would come back to haunt me
Crooked smile, the reflection in your eyes
That shows Why wait this for Beautiful mistakes

Something that I know you've seen before
I'm not the first
Set the trap, I've fallen for it every time
I can't believe, everyone you told this to
This would come back to haunt me
I can't stand to see you now
How could I ever trust you

Take it back to the streets
I'll start again
I'll never look back
I'll never look back, back
How do you feel it if
you don't feel anything
Don't have a heart attack
don't have a heart attack
But I won't stop you

Cutting Me, razor blades and perfect lines
Were just, you'll get anything you want
Broken hearts surround everything you wanna say
Which shows, why wait this for Falling in my path

My wallowing despair that shines in black
It consumes me, I'll take it back
Give it back, to what it was
I can't believe Everyone you told this to
This would come back to haunt me
I can't stand to see you now
How could I ever trust you

Take it back to the streets
I'll start again
I'll never look back
I'll never look back, back
How do you feel it if
you don't feel anything
Don't have a heart attack
don't have a heart attack!
But I won't stop you

Everyone you promised to
This would come back to haunt me
I can't stand to see you now
How could I ever trust you

Cut me out, of your life
Like its nothing (Like I'm nothing)
Wait for this
You can't love, Don't explain it

Part of me is gone,
you've taken
You've taken
You've taken
You've taken
Part of me is gone,
you've take
You've taken
A piece thats from me

Take it back to the streets
I'll start again
I'll never look back
I'll never look back, back
How do you feel it if
you don't feel anything
Don't have a heart attack
don't have a heart attack
But I won't stop you

You won't stop, you'll never change
You won't stop, you'll never change
