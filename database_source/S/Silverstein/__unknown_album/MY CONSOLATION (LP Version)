You left me,
now you come back to me saying it's changed
and we're not the same people we once were.
And you beg to be back with me,
I can't see anything but you.
Every night, I see you there.
Everyday, I hate you and everything we once were.
You keep saying it's changed and we're not the same.
And you beg to be back with me,
now I can't see anything.
I won't forget everything that you put us through.
Every night, I see you there.
Everyday, I hate you.
Crying can't carry you back to me.
