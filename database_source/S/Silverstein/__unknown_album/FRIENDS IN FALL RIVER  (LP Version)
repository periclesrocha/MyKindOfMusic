Your life lives half a nation away
My heart hurts so
I believe letting you go
Was the biggest mistake of my life

What did I do?
Alone and confused
What can I say?
What can I do?
I'm heading the wrong way home
Knowing alone is alone
It's just too difficult to be just me instead of we

What did I do?
Alone and confused
What can I say?
Nothing
I don't know where to begin since you left me for him
I don't know where to begin and you left me for him
I don't want to start again, and I can't be your friend
I don't know where to begin since you left me for him
