My heart bleeds no more
Now, it's been turned to stone
Your stomach feels sick for someone else
But I've broken both my legs falling for you
Drag me on the ground.

Powerless I stand,
Tarnished blade, cutting through,
Pushed into my vein, blood still stains my hands
Sharpening my sense of pain outside

My heart bleeds no more
Now, it's been turned to stone
Your stomach feels sick for someone else
But, I've broken both my legs falling for you
Drag me on the ground.

Killing everything off inside.
Make sense of everything you tried to hide,
hide from me.

My heart bleeds no more
Now, it's been turned to stone.
My stomach feels sore from cutting up.
But, I ruined all my sanctity for you.
Smash me on the ground.

I wanted to convince myself there's nothing else to do
I wanted to provide you with proof of what you put me through
I wanted to pretend that it was you.
(You're the worst thing that ever happened to me!)

Die!
Killing everything off inside
Make sense of everything you tried to hide
Hide from me

My heart bleeds no more
Now, it's been turned to stone
Your stomach feels sick for someone else
But I've broken both my legs falling for you
Smash me on the ground.
