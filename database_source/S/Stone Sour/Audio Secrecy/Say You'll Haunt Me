Little supernovas in my head
Little soft pulses in my dead
Little souvenirs and secrets shared
A little off guard and unprepared

I was never good enough to find
I was never bad enough to mind
In the middle I will do my best
Take me in your arms and leave the rest

I will give you anything to

Say you want to stay, you want me too
Say you’ll never die, you’ll always haunt me
I wanna know I belong to you
Say you’ll haunt me

Together, together, we’ll be together, together forever

Little variations on my page
Little doors open on my cage
Little time has come and gone so far
Little-by-little, who you are?

I can see the patterns on your face
I can see the miracles I trace
Symmetry and shadows I can’t hide
I just wanna be right by your side

I will give you everything to

Say you want to stay, you want me too
Say you’ll never die, you’ll always haunt me
I wanna know I belong to you
Say you’ll haunt me

Say you want to stay, you want me too
Say you’ll never die, you’ll always haunt me
I wanna know I belong to you
Say you’ll haunt me

Together, together, we’ll be together, together forever
I belong to you
Together, together, we’ll be together, together forever
I belong to you

Little supernovas in my head
Little soft pulses in my dead
Little souvenirs and secrets shared
A little off guard and unprepared

I will give you anything to
I will give you everything to

Say you want to stay, you want me too
Say you’ll never die, you’ll always haunt me
I wanna know I belong to you
Say you’ll haunt me

Say you want to stay, you want me too
Say you’ll never die, you’ll always haunt me
I wanna know I belong to you
Say you’ll haunt me

Together, together, we’ll be together, together forever
I belong to you
Together, together, we’ll be together, together forever
I belong to you
