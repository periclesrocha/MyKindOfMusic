Can you tell me how far I’ve come
And can you tell me where I’ve been?
Never stopped, I knew I should have run but now
I don’t remember where I am
All my life I’ve been holding back
Consider this my last request
Everything for all my best

Open up the sun and burn my eyes
Open up your arms and save my life

I know I’ll never go home again
I need a little more but I will take what I can get
I promise you everything, everything
Just don’t forget me in the end

Right in front of my face
And in between our little wars
This was something I couldn’t have
And that just made me want it more
Now I know the reason I was built like this
Now I know why I am here
I am here for you

Open up the sun and burn my eyes
Open up your arms and save my life

I know I’ll never go home again
I need a little more but I will take what I can get
I promise you everything, everything
Just don’t forget me in the end

Open up the sun and burn my eyes
Open up your arms and save my life

I know I’ll never go home again
I need a little more but I will take what I can get
I promise you everything, everything
Just don’t forget me in the end

Open up the sun and burn my eyes
Open up the sun and burn my eyes
Open up your arms and save my life
