Stabbing hacking
Twisting the knife
Crushing killing
Reaping of life

Covered in remains
Reeking of death
Eyes of demon
Flesh of mortal man

Tearing the flesh
Annihilate the enemy
Bodies torn in half
Agonizing butchery
Dead now ablaze
Burning for the god's to see
Into the flame
Sacrifice humanity

Brutalized and pulverized
Blood pours from your soul

Stabbing hacking
Twisting the knife
Crushing killing
Reaping of life
Covered in entrails
Reeking of death
Eyes of a demon
Flesh of mortal man

Blood for the slaughtergod
Taking skulls that will build its throne
Massacre with no remorse
Rendering flesh from bone
