If I could make through tonight
That would be alright with me

’Cause I’ll deny anything I said
That lets you know that I’m not dead
Why can’t you see

Why can’t you see that the truth lies inside of me?
And all the things that I can’t be
And everything I never knew revolves around the fact that
You don’t need me anymore I know
I guess I’ll have to let you go
I’ll let you go now, I’ll let you go

I’ll admit I lie awake at night
And I’ll admit that I haven’t got that right
And I’ll admit that I got nothing left to do
But I won’t admit to needing you
I’ll never say that’s true, not to you

I can tell that you don’t care
’Cause I can see your staring on
That is killing me

And if I had a choice I wouldn’t listen to your voice
And everything it is it wouldn’t have to be
I wish that I could change the past so it doesn’t leave so fast
And I would be a different man and do the things I think I can
To wash away the traces of your face that whisper through my mind
And leave me hanging on inside the broken world of mine

I’ll admit I lie awake at night
And I’ll admit that I haven’t got that right
And I’ll admit that I got nothing left to do
But I won’t admit to needing you
I’ll never say that’s true, not to you

I’ll admit I lie awake at night
And I’ll admit that I haven’t got that right
And I’ll admit that I got nothing left to do
But I won’t admit to needing you
I’ll never say that’s true, not to you
