Everything is just fine
If you feel that way, it’s just not mine
To want to be the one thing on everybody’s mind
I never asked so much from you
But there’s nothing I can do
To ease the pain of knowing I am nothing way deep down inside

I don’t know what else you could want from me, ’cause I did all I should
I gave you more than any self-respecting person ever would
I’ll never be the one you want, I’ll never be the one you need
Why can’t you see the truth, ’cause I just don’t know what else to believe now

Everything is just great
If you feel that way, I just can’t hate enough
But now I know it’s just a little bit too late
I have to live inside this pain
But it’s driving me insane
And I’ve got everything to lose
And nothing left to gain

I don’t know what else you could want from me, ’cause I did all I should
I gave you more than any self-respecting person ever would
I’ll never be the one you want, I’ll never be the one you need
Why can’t you see the truth, ’cause I just don’t know what else to believe now

Everything is all good
If you feel that way, I wish that you would leave me be
’Cause I’ve already done all that I should
I didn’t choose to live this way
But it’s just the price I pay
And I think about the things I’m missing every single day

I don’t know what else you could want from me, ’cause I did all I should
I gave you more than any self-respecting person ever would
I’ll never be the one you want, I’ll never be the one you need
Why can’t you see the truth, ’cause I just don’t know what else to believe now
