Voices call out my name, my name, my name
They say I’m different — well I’m not the same, the same
The say you want to be like me
Well, boy, lemme tell ya, you don’t know what I’ve seen

They say the devil lives in my soul
I promise not to let him take control

I’m minding my own business
I ain’t doing nothing wrong — ain’t doing nothing wrong

Shadows follow so close behind me
I look in my mirror — I don’t like what I see
Why god, can’t you help me get out of here, here?
I feel like I’m living deep in hell

I’m minding my own business
I ain’t doing nothing wrong

I’m minding my own business
I ain’t doing nothing wrong

I said that I
I’m minding, I’m minding
My own, own
Ain’t doing nothing wrong
Ain’t doing nothing wrong
Nothing wrong
