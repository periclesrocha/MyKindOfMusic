You push me I shove back
I'm the weak one
Always getting harassed
Violence my last solution t
Taking out the problem
The only way out
Does the way I look
Make me that different from you?
I'm sick of being abused
what have I ever done to you?
II can only take so much
Today is the day I wash my hands of you
Will we ever learn?
Someday
can you take back the pain you have given?
Will we ever learn?
Someday
can you take back the pain you have given?
Toda's the day I put my torment to the end
