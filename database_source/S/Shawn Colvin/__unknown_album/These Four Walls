I'm gonna die in these four walls
I've had enough and I've tried it all
I'll watch the day break and I'll see the night fall
In these four walls

Show me trouble I'll take him down
I drew a line on this patch of ground
Everything's safe and everything's sound
In these four walls

Up on the rooftop
I can remember
Borders I had to break
Now I can see I had this life
To make

I'm gonna miss your southern drawl
A baby's footsteps in an empty hall
And every little thing I can ever recall
In these four walls

Up on the rooftop
Feel like you're flying
Thinking your heart could break
Oh can't you see we had this love
To make

I'm gonna die in these four walls
I've had enough and I've tried it all
I'll watch the day break and I'll see the night fall
In these four walls.
