In time I'll get this out of
Get this out of
Out of my mind
Where am I
I can't see I
fear for my life
Fear of this fright

They haunt me
And they taunt me
Try to relax
Let it happen
My hopes turn to crystal matter
Watch them shimmer
As they shatter

Night terrors in my mind
Thoughts I cannot hide
Dreams that play on my cold fears
Night terrors in my head
Am I really dead
I can't tell, it feels so real

Remember what you once said
Every passing fragile moment
Is another chance to turn it around
I want to try to work it out

Night terrors in my mind
Thoughts I cannot hide
Dreams that play on my cold fears
Night terrors in my head
Am I really dead
I can't tell, it feels so real to me

Get out of my mind
Get out of my head
I wish you were dead
I can't take it
Get out of my mind
Get out of my life
I'll curse you tonight
I just can't take it anymore

Night terrors in my mind
Thoughts I cannot hide
Dreams that play on my cold fears
Night terrors in my head
Am I really dead
I can't tell, it feels so real

Night terrors in my mind
Thoughts I cannot hide
Dreams that play on my cold fears
Night terrors in my head
Am I really dead
I can't tell, it feels so real to me
