So our open wounds will bleed
Until our veins run dry
Now we have to take this thorn
And tear it from our side

Agitated at the fault line
Still agreed to disagree
You're connected to the heart
But tonight we'll set you free

So swallow the knife
Carve the way for your pride
Now our hands are tied
The problems lie within
So we pray for night
To start over again

Even now as I write this down
All pretensions disappear
Now our impulses will bite
At the ankles of our fear

So swallow the knife
Carve the way for your pride
Now our hands are tied
The problems lie within
So we pray for night
To start over again

Now our hands are tied
The problems lie within
So we pray for night
To start over again

Words are spoken
Words are broken down

So let's make this night
Be our best mistake
So let's take the time
To wipe the blood away

Now our hands are tied
And the world is caving in

Now our hands are tied
The problems lie within
So we pray for night
To start over again

Now our hands are tied
And the problems lie within
Words are spoken
Words are broken down
Broken down
Broken down
