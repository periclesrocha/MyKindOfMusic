Gently, my mind escapes into the relaxing world of pleasure...
A pleasure that'll take my mind off the reality of my life...
My past life...
Life as I know it now!

And whatever may come, it slowly disappears!
To somewhere in the back of my mind...
It will remain there... 'til I wish to retrieve it!




Yes, I will stay here for awhile, for I need the break!
A break from the pressures of life!
And everything that lays in the palm of life's hands!
Life's hands!



This mode is incredible! It's out of this world!
Too bad I must always leave it...

That's life
That's life
That's life
That's life
