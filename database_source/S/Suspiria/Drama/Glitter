Now she brings herself
To lay
In love’s domain
Amid the debris
Bring herself to drown
In cool attentions paid
By lords, their look
So young and strange
Seeing in their eyes
A charming sympathy, unchained
It hangs, in crystalline

In places where that glitter shines
A passive faith in shreds, in lights
She needs this floor beneath her feet
She needs these places…

Throws another party down
Amid the debris
Surrounds herself in
Whispered hearts and minds
He folds around the tiles
Like ice
Once dressed in guilty tapestries
And dresses
Unveiled, that jewel of
Reason glistens
Hangs, in crystalline

In places where that glitter shines
A passive faith in shreds, in lights
She needs this floor beneath her feet
To cast her saviours…

She needs these places
Where that glitter shines…
She needs these places
Where that glitter shines…

In places where that glitter shines
A passive faith in shreds, in lights
She needs this floor beneath her feet
To cast her saviours aside

In places where that glitter shines
A passive faith in shreds, in lights
She needs this floor beneath her feet
To cast her saviours aside

Where that glitter shines…

Where that glitter shines…
