Sacred heart
My sacred heart
Sacred heart
Spare my sacred heart

Hear my confession while it’s on my mind
One holy hour of your precious time
Could save my soul
(Whoa-ooh…)

Bitter memories will fade away
You could make this fallen angel’s day
If you’ll be there
If you’ll take care of

My sacred heart
Spare my sacred heart (my sacred heart)
My sacred heart (I give)
I give to you

My sacred heart
Spare my sacred heart

Outside the flowers of the forest bleed
Soldiers of fortune sow their deadly seeds
Your sanctity
Is all I need (all I need)

I’ve tried cathedrals and holy grails
I’ve looked for love on every golden trail
With you (you) I rest
Take (take) what’s left of

My sacred heart
Spare my sacred heart (my sacred heart)
My sacred heart (I give)
I give to you

My sacred heart
Forever
And ever
Be true

Forever
And ever
Let it be for you

My sacred heart
Spare my sacred heart (woo, my sacred heart)
My sacred heart
I give to you

My sacred heart
Spare my sacred heart (my-my-my sacred heart)
Sacred heart
Spare my sacred heart (heart)

My sacred heart (my sacred, woo, my sacred heart)
(Heart)
(Sacred heart…)
