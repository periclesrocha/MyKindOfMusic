This is my blues
Cause I'm back down on my own again

This is the blues I'm playing
Yes, it's a final thing
When the night is cold and lonely

This is the midnight blues

This is the midnight blues
For the girl I left behind me

Ain't it the final thing
This is the blues
Just a feeling deep inside of me

This is the midnight blues
