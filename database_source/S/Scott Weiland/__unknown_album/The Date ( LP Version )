She waits for a date
And yet she knows that he's not coming
He waits for the date
And yet he knows that he's not coming

I hope that it's not the break-up
And I hope that it's just the break
I hope that it's not the break-up
And I hope that it's just the break

(repeat)

I love you, I love you...(to fade)
