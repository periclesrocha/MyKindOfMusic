An imitation from New York
You're made in Japan from cheese and chalk
You're hippy type zeros 'cause you put on a bad show
You put on a bad show, oh, don't it show

Still out on those pills
Oh do you remember?

Think it's swell playing
You're looking bored and you're acting flash
With nothing in your gut, to keep your mouth shut
You better keep your mouth shut, you're in a rut

Still out on those pills
Oh do the sambo

You're four years on, you still look the same
I think it's about time you changed you brain
You're just a pile of shit, you're coming to this
You poor little faggot, you're sealed with a kiss

Kiss me
Ha ha ha ha ha

Think it's swell playing in Japan
When everybody knows Japan is a dishpan
You're just a pile of shit, you're coming to this
You poor little faggot, you're sealed with a kiss

Still out on those pills
Cheap thrills, , , anything
You're condemned to eternal bullshit
You're sealed with a kiss

Kiss me

A kiss, a kiss, you're sealed with a kiss
A-looking for a kiss, you're coming to this

You do just about anything
Oh kiss this
Eh boy
