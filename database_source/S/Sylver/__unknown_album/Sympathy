I don't want your sympathy
It's mylife and l will be free
I don't want your sympathy
It's my life and I just need me

It's over again
You made up your mind
Still wanna be my friend
But don't waste your time
Cause I've just about had it with you
And I won't be nobody's fool

I don't want your sympathy
It's my life and I will be free
I don't want your sympathy
It's my life and I will be free
I don't want your sympathy
It's my life and I just need me

It's over again
There's doubt in your eyes
The message has been sent
Now you have to pay the price
Cause I've just about had it with you
And I won't be nobody's fool

I don't want your sympathy
I don't want your sympathy

I don't want your sympathy
It's my life and I will be free
I don't want your sympathy
It's my life and I just need me
I don't want your sympathy
It's my life and I will be free
I don't want your sympathy
It's my life and I just need me
