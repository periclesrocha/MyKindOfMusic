I'm digging through the darkness
Cause I'm a long wall miner
Following the road down
Just so I can sit beside her
I'm a page torn from your novel
Beneath a magnet on your fridge
I'm a star stuck on your ceiling
So I can watch you while you're sleeping

Do you remember me
Do you remember me because
I wanted you so bad
Do you remember me
Do you remember me because
Everything we had

Was like a hammer to a stone
Wrapped like a fender around a tree
The curiosity in you
And all the emptiness in me

Digging through the vices
I don't know where the inside is
Well here's my dirty little secret
And I bet you, you can't keep it

I'm a page torn from your novel
A single flower in your lawn
If I'm not everything you wished for
How come you miss me when I'm gone?

Do you remember me
Do you remember me because
I wanted you so bad
Do you remember me
Do you remember me because
Everything we had

Was like a hammer to a stone
Wrapped like a fender around a tree
The curiosity in you
And all the emptiness in me
They say a diamond only whispers
To us when we are alone
It's just forever's little trick
To help a hammer find a stone
Help a hammer find a stone
