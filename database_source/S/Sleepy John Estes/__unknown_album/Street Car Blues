Now, I know the people
Is 'onna wonder, ev'rywhere
I say, I know the people
Is 'onna wonder, ev'rywhere
Because they heard of poor John
Was saw around 'lectric car

Now, catch the Central car for


Ride it down to Central Street
I say, I catch the Central car for
Ride it down to Central Street
Lord, I'm 'onna ease it down in Rovers
Catch my baby out on a midnight train

Lord, reason why baby, I
I been so long writin' to you
I said the reason why, baby
I been so long writin' to you
Because I been studyin' so hard
Lord, how to all sing these blues

'Sing 'em boy, for Mr. James!'

Lord, I lost my papa and my dear mama, too
I say, I love my papa and my dear mama, too
Lord, I'm gonna quit my bad way of livin'
And visit the Sunday school.
