James, James hold the ladder steady
James, James I'm packed tonight I'm ready
James, James hold the ladder steady
I'm a'comin' down to your ar-ar-ar-rms
I'm a'comin' down to your arms.
Now James and I we went to mama and showed her my diamond ring
She said "my poor little baby, you must be crazy, to think of such a thing"
So James, James hold the ladder steady
James, James I'm packed tonight I'm ready
James, James hold the ladder steady
I'm a'comin' down to your ar-ar-ar-rms
I'm a'comin' down to your arms.
Now James and I we went to daddy and said that we want to be wed
Daddy said "nope, you'll just have to elope" and laughed as he went to bed"
But James, James hold the ladder steady
James, James I'm packed tonight I'm ready
James, James hold the ladder steady
I'm a'comin' down to your ar-ar-ar-rms
I'm a'comin' down to your arms.
I'd hate to see 'em in the morning when they both completely flip
He'll be sayin' "they cain't", she'll be feeling faint"
And I'll be kissing my husband's lips
So James, James hold the ladder steady
James, James I'm packed tonight I'm ready
James, James hold the ladder steady
I'm a'comin' down to your ar-ar-ar-rms
I'm a'comin' down to your arms.

James, James hold the ladder steady
James, James I'm packed tonight I'm ready
James, James hold the ladder steady
