Don't know why I still slept on my side of the bed,
The emptiness when you were gone
Kept ringing in my head,
Told myself I really had to move along,
Stop regretting all the things I left unsaid.

So I tore up your letters,
Took your picture off the wall.
I deleted your number,
It was too hard not to call.
And then I told myself that I would be fine
Gotta live for the good times.

'Cause everywhere I go there's a love song that reminds me of you,
And even though I knew I had to be strong I'm still not over you
'Cause I still believe and could see how there's nothing left of you and me.
Our time is over,
But I'm so not over you.

All my friends tried to tell me
That I'd find somebody new.
Why waste time being lonely,
When there's nothing left to loose.
Anything to get you out of my mind.
I'm a fool if I thought I could forget,
And I could not forget.

'Cause everywhere I go there's a love song that reminds me of you,
And even though I knew I had to be strong I'm still not over you
'Cause I still believe and could see how there's nothing left of you and me.
Our time is over.
But I'm so not over you.

Now I found a way to keep you there beside me,
To where my love for you cannot be denied.
I can only hope to keep you there to guide me,
There's no more need to hide from all this pain inside.

'Cause everywhere I go there's a love song that reminds me of you,
And even though I knew I had to be strong I'm still not over you.
'Cause I still believe and could see how there's nothing left of you and me.
Our time is over.
But I'm so not over you.
