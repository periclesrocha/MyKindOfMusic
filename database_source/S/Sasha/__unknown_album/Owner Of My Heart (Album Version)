If you think I've let you down
Tried to fool you
There's no need to
If you think I've played around
Why'd you worry
You should know me
I've been true right from the start
You're the owner of my heart

If you look straight in my eyes
You will know I'm not pretending
I don't hide, there's no disguise
Why you doubt me, that's a strange thing
I've been true right from the start
You're the owner of my heart

I can't stand by watching you walk away
Knowing you still belong with me
Close by my side
You think I don't care
But forever, I swear
Ooh, my love has grown stronger
And that I can't hide
I've been true right from the start
You're the owner of my heart

Ooh...

I've been true right from the start
You're the owner of my heart

Oh, oh, no one can tell me
Cause I know for sure
When I'm not with you, baby
I'm wasting my time
I'll do anything that you want me to do
Ooh, just call out my name
Can't she give me a sign
Give me a sign, oh, oh

If you just give me some time (some time)
To convince you
We can pull through (we can pull through)
Let me see what's on your mind (on your mind)
I won't change you, I don't have to
I've been true right from the start (oh. oh, oh)
You're the owner of my heart
I've been true right from the start
You're the owner of my heart
I've been true right from the start
You're the owner of my heart
