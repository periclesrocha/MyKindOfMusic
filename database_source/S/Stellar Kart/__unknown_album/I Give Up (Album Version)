I am overrated
One of the future faded
Who bought into the scam
All I thought was something
Still adds up to nothing
So everything I am

I give up
I'm laying it down
I've had enough
Of living without you
I'm letting go
Of what I was
So long
Goodbye
Go

If I'm being honest
How could you have wanted
This heart so defective
But what it all comes down to
When my world revolves around you
I begin to live

I surrender
Raising my white flag
I'm not holding back
Everything is yours
