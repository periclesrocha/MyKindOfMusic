Yeah, yeah, yeah
Now tell you what

It's mind control, mind control
Corruption of your thoughts (yeah), destruction of your soul
Mind control, it's mind control
Corruption of your thoughts (yeah), destruction of your soul

Don't let them mould your mind, they want to control mankind
Seems like their only intention is to exploit the earth (hey)
And you trust in their deceit, your mind causes your defeat
And so you become an invention to distort this earth

Propaganda and lies, is a plague in our lives
How much more victimised, before we realise (hey)

It's mind control, mind control
Corruption of your thoughts (yeah), destruction of your soul
Mind control, it's mind control
Corruption of your thoughts (yeah), destruction of your soul

Ooh grand master, let the people go
You put them in total confusion, to downs-troy their soul
For they practise what you preach, so they're always in your reach
High-tech slavery in these days, it's mind control

They'll make it attractive, to get man distracted
corrupting your, polluting your
destroying (your soul, mind control)
Mind control
Corruption of your thoughts (yeah), destruction of your soul
Mind control, it's mind control
Corruption of your thoughts (yeah), destruction of your soul

Come on and, get it together brother man
What, what you say?
Yeah

It's mind control, mind control
Corruption of your thoughts (yeah), destruction of your soul
Mind control, it's mind control
Corruption of your thoughts (yeah), destruction of your soul

(the truth is there for us to see)
It's mind control, mind control
Corruption of your thoughts (yeah), destruction of your soul
(the truth is there for us to see)
Mind control, it's mind control
Corruption of your thoughts (yeah), destruction of your soul

(the truth is there for us to see)
(the truth is there for us to see)
(the truth is there for us to see)
