Its all about our love
So shall it be forever
never ending

After all this time
After all is said and done

We have seen some
suffering baby
It has not always been perfect

After all this time
After all is said and done

Darling we know it
Whatever may come
We can get through it
As if its just begun
Oh its just begun

Its all about our love
So shall it be forever
never ending
Darling we know it

After all this time
After all said and done

After all this time
After all said and done
