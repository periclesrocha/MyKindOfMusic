We cast no shadow
The stars do not shine here
Be content to light your own path
And burn what you have crossed
The bridges were frail
The people, pretended

Storm forth with the light of the inflamed
Reclaim and ignite the sky
Brightly to blind
Rip off the veneers enabling opportunists to thrive
Dam the rise of grime and rats

More sickening than a social circle that believes itself charmed
Are the writhing droves of blowhards and yes men
Clamoring to slither in
Stay sovereign on the outside

We are who finished last
The unaffected
Contrasting the wide and white
We are who finish last
Sound
Indignant
The iron to gleaming teeth
The salt on saccharin
We who finish last
Proudly in their darkness
Lit from within

Glad hands grabbing for brass rings
Painting their bricks gold
Keen sycophants filthy scheming
Furthering the feuds of their adored
They have picked their enemies impeccably
Very keen indeed

And so siege the scorned

We are naught but beds of thorns and dark horses
Unwelcome guests who will just not mind their place
A single musket ball to pierce and lodge inside
And lead the circle to crack

We cast no shadow
The stars do not shine here
No genuine light to be found
Only rays of cold, synthetic beams on a mock aristocracy
so the vain and insecure can feel revered and cared for
For a cheap, fleeting moment
Truly noble

Storm forth with the light
We who finish last
Proudly in our darkness
Lit from within

Conflict in the chest
To be concerned for the needs of such heartless men
