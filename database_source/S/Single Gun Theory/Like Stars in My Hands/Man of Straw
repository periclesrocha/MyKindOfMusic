The dawn to life
Lies shattered on the floor
And I’ve been told
You’re not coming back no more

Your hands were bleeding
Your heart was raw
Your hopes were curved and gutted
Man of straw

Man of straw
I’ve been told
You won’t be back
Won’t be back

In the sprawl that is suburban
Lying dormant in a home
You realized your calling
In that catatonic role

Man of straw
Man of straw
I’ve been told
You won’t be back

You’ve gone to be a beacon
Out in space
Formless, splashing, seeking
Homeless, in disgrace

[Every corner of my body, even my mind — pure white, shining silver, frozen]
