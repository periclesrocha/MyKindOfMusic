Concede and believe me
I won't give up I won't give out on you
Concede and believe me
I won't give up I won't give out on you
Oh no no no la la la la la
You, oh no

Now here I promise to listen
why won't you go for that
and here i promise to hold you
why won't you go for that

If I had wings and I could fly
well i'd still walk with you
If I had a safe place to lie
I'd want to lay with you

Concede and believe me
I won't give up I won't give out on you
Concede and believe me
I won't give up I won't give out on you
Oh no no no la la la la la
you, oh no

So now you shut off oh and you shut down
and won't let nobody in
and when you shut off oh and you shut down
won't play that fool again

I see your inside
you stay inside
and i won't go for that
I see your quarters oh your crooked sacred pictures on the wall

Concede and believe me
I won't give up and I won't give out on you
Concede and believe me
I won't give up I won't give out on you
oh no no no la la la la la
you, oh no

I'll be your jester, I'll be your fool
Comprising fool
I'll be your jester, I'll be your fool

Concede and believe me
I won't give up and won't give out on you
Concede and believe me
I won't give up I won't give out
