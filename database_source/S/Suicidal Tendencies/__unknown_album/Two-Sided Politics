I'm not anti-society, society's anti-me
I'm not anti-religion, religion is anti-me
I'm not anti-tradition, tradition is anti-me
I'm not anti-anything, I just wanna be free
Fascist state, no freedom
Unless you control yourself
Use self expression, lose your freedom
You're undesirable, you go straight to jail
Kill someone, in a war
Get a medal, you're a hero
Protect yourself in every day war
You're a minority you go straight to jail
I'm not anti-Reagan, Reagan's anti-me
I'm not anti-government, government's anti-me
I'm not anti-politics, politics is anti-me
I'm not anti-anything, I just wannna be free
Innocent, never guilty
High class lawyer, you are rich
If you're poor must be guilty
Even if innocent you go straight to jail
