It's going down in my dark side
My mind starts sweating my heart
It starts a chain reaction
That's now the pain it all starts

It's going down where no one can see
It's a sad sad sight
The feeling just gets stronger
I see you, I just put on a smile
I try to cover it up
But I can't take it too much longer

Time stands still, as I lie in place
I try to block out the pitch
In my head that keeps ringing
So I pound and pound on myself
I try to wake myself up
But I can't 'cause I'm not dreaming

It's going down in my dark side
With no release or escape
Doesn't beleave in forgiveness
It's an emotion rape

It's going down where no one can see
It's sad sad sight
No suspense as what will follow
Fractured terror fills my peace
Shocks my senses
Leaves me empty sad and hollow

Time stands still, as I lie in place
I try to block out the pitch
In my head that keeps ringing
So I pound and pound on myself
I try to wake myself up
But I can't 'cause I'm not dreaming

Chorus:
It's goin' down, it's goin' down
It's goin' down, it's goin' down
It's goin' down, it's goin' down
It's goin' down, it' goin'
It's goin' down

It's going down in my dark side
Shivers and shakes through my soul
Ration surveys the damage
There's nothing left to control

It's going down now, I'm face to face
With the hollowness
That echos in this darkness
How can I fight when I cannot see what to fight
Reluctanly how can I even stop this
All hell is breaking loose
Now panic rules as emotions blazed on fire

I'm goin' down down down down down
I'm goin' down
I'm so damn tired

Chorus

It's going down in my dark side
