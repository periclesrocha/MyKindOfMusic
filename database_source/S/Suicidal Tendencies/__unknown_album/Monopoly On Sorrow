There's a cold wind in the winter of my mind
A season that last through all changes in time
I try so hard sometimes
I wish there was a raincheck on tommorow
Not ready to deal with what I don't wanna find

Struggling on, just to hold on
I just wanna know, why is it me?

In a tear there is a message from the heart
Detached from the good, it's hope gone astray
I cry so hard sometimes
Too scared to think what will bring tommorow
Already much more than I can handle today

I can't breathe, suffocate as I'm buried by hate
And so sadly I learn, there's no justice to fate
I just wanna know why is it me?
Losing the race with thoughts out of place
I just wanna, know why is it me?

You aint got a monopoly on sorrow
You know plenty has made it my way
You aint got a monopoly on sorrow
There's plenty that feel just the same

There's a pain so insane that I fight but can't tame
And my mind battles on as my body lies lame

I can't feel the feel but it feels like it hurts
I can't feel the feel but it feels like it hurts
I can't feel the feel but it feels like it hurts
I can't feel the feel but it feels like it hurts
Hurts, hurts
And I know that I know I don't know that I know
It just would stay clear then I'd see and I'd go
I just wanna know why it's me
Aint got a monopoly on sorrow

You, you, you aint got no no, you aint got no no
You aint got no no, you aint got no no
There's no monopoly on sorrow
No monopoly on sorrow
No monopoly on sorrow
No monopoly on sorrow no no no

You ain't got no no no, you ain't got no no no
You ain't got no no no, you ain't got no no no
No monopoly on sorrow
Monopoly on sorrow
Monopoly on sorrow
No no no no no
You ain't got no, no no no no
You ain't got no, no no no no
You ain't got no, no no no no
You ain't got no monopoly on sorrow
