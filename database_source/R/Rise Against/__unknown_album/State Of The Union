If we're the flagship of peace and prosperity
We're taking on water and about to fuckin' sink
No one seems to notice, no one even blinks
The crew all left the passengers to die under the sea

Countdown, to the very end
Equality, an invitation that we won't extend
Ready aim, pull the trigger now
In time you firmly secure your place in hell

State of the union address
Reads war torn country still a mess
The words: power, death, and distorted truth
Are read between the lines of the red, white, and blue

Countdown, to the very end
Equality, an invitation that we won't extend
Ready aim, pull the trigger now
In time you firmly secure your place in hell

Your place in hell
Your place in hell

'Guilty' is what our graves will read
No years, no family, we did
Nothing (nothing) to stop the murder of
A people just like us
