Deep inside these burning buildings
Voices die to be heard
Years we spent teaching a lesson
We ourselves had never learned

And if strength is born from heartbreak
Then mountains I could move
And if walls could speak I'd pray
That they would tell me what to do

If you see me, please just walk on by, walk on by
Forget my name and I'll forget it too
(Simple lives...) failed attempts at living simple lives, simple lives
Always keep me coming back to you

No signs of life here, save the embers, the occasional flame
We'd know the way but can't remember, conception to the grave
Shout confessions from the greatest heights, where no one can hear
All my fears, my insecurities are falling like tears

If you see me, please just walk on by, walk on by
Forget my name and I'll forget it too
(Simple lives...) failed attempts at living simple lives, simple lives
Always keep me coming back to you.

The drones will slave away, they're working overtime
They serve a faceless queen, they never question why
(I won't come back!) disciples of a God, they neither live nor breathe
(I won't come back!) but we have bills to pay, yeah we have mouths to feed!
I won't come back!

And if you see me, please just walk on by, walk on by
Forget my name and I'll forget it too
(Simple lives...) failed attempts at living simple lives, simple lives
Always keep me coming back to you

I'm coming back to you!
