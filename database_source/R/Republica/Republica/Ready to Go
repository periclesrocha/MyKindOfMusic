Ready to go

Ready to go

You’re weird, in tears, too near and too far away
He said, saw red, went home, stayed in bed all day
Your t-shirt, dish dirt
Always love the one you hurt

It’s a crack, I’m back, yeah, I’m standing
On the rooftop shouting out
Baby, I’m ready to go
I’m back and ready to go
From the rooftop shout it out

It’s a crack, I’m back, yeah, I’m standing
On the rooftop having it
Baby, I’m ready to go
I’m back and ready to go
From the rooftop shout it out, shout it out

You sleep, too deep, one week is another world
(Big mouth), big mouth, (drop out), drop out
You get what you deserve
You’re strange, insane, one thing you can never change

It’s a crack, I’m back, yeah, I’m standing
On the rooftop shouting out
Baby, I’m ready to go
I’m back and ready to go
From the rooftop shout it out

It’s a crack, I’m back, yeah, I’m standing
On the rooftop having it
Baby, I’m ready to go
I’m back and ready to go
From the rooftop shout it out, shout it out

Ready to go

Abused, confused, always love the one that
Hurt ya, hurt ya, hurt ya, hurt ya

It’s a crack, I’m back, yeah, I’m standing
On the rooftop shouting out
Baby, I’m ready to go
I’m back and ready to go
From the rooftop shout it out

It’s a crack, I’m back, yeah, I’m standing
On the rooftop having it
Baby, I’m ready to go
I’m back and ready to go
From the rooftop shout it out

It’s a crack

Baby, I’m ready to go

Baby, I’m ready to go

Baby, I’m ready to go

Baby, I’m ready to go

Baby, I’m ready to go

Baby, I’m ready to go
Baby, I’m ready to go
Baby, I’m ready to go

Baby, I’m ready to go

Baby, I’m ready to go
