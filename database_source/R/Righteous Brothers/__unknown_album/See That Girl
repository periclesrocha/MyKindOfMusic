See that girl?
Look at her good.
That's something you don't
see every day, now.
Dig those eyes...
Ain't they a prize?
They sure can get to you,
and, hey now,
Look at that crazy smile
I bet you can't believe
She was mine for a while,
Ain't she somethin?
See that guy?
Right by her side.
He's feelin' proud, and
don't he show it.
Look and see,
That could have been me.
Would you believe I'd go
and blow it?
I let her slip away,
And I tell myself I'm okay
But it just tears the
heart out of me
When I see that girl....
When I see that girl.
(break)
I let her slip away
And I tell myself I'm okay
But it just tears the
heart out of me
When I see that girl....
When I see that girl....
When I see that girl.
