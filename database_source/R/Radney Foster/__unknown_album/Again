Ain't it funny the turns life puts you through
Don't know what's round the bend
Lord you don't know where it's leading you
Close your eyes say a prayer
Take it on the chin it's the
Darnedest thing who comes round again
Baby I thought that
Love was over and gone for-

To me never gonna hold me again but
Your love pounds in my heart like
Thunder flashes through me like
Lightning making me believe Again
Don't know what I'm supposed to say
Ain't got a clue bout what I need to do
All I know is what I feel
Right here right now with you
Baby I thought that
Love was over and gone for-
–ever never gonna come back
To me never gonna hold me again but
Your love pounds in my heart like
Thunder flashes through me like
Lightning making me believe A-

Love was over and gone for-
–ever never gonna come back
To me never gonna hold me again but
Your love pounds in my heart like
Thunder flashes through me like
Lightning making me believe
