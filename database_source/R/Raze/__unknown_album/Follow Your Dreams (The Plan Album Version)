Gonna be all right
Do doâ€¦
One more

There was a boy who lay awake at night
Dreamin' what he would do with his life
What would it take to pay the rent in for that sunny day
That sunny day

I can't tell you what to do
You've got your dreams, I've got mine too
You can make it if you try
All I wanna say tonight is

"Follow your dreams and you will see
Anything you want you can achieve
Time to begin, fly like the wind
Breakin' down these walls you will be free"


All right
Gonna be all right
Do do...

Now that little boy is all grown up
So you see that the little boy was me
And I came here to let you know
That I found that sunny day
That sunny day

I can't tell you what to do
The dreams you hold will get you through
The power you need comes from within
Really know it's in your hands



Follow your dreams and you will see
Anything you want you can achieve
Time to begin, fly like the wind
Breakin' down these walls you will be free

I heard time and time again
How everybody's got a dream but they feel they won't win
'Cause somebody who was willin', who wanted to be chillin'
So they could never make it even if they were willin'
So we threw together this old school flow
So everybody in my generation oughta know
No matter what we take from this scene
Now you and me can follow our dreams

I can't tell you what to do
You've got your dreams, I've got mine too
You can make it if you try


All right
Gonna be all right
Anything you want you can achieve
Gonna be all right
Breakin' down these walls you will be free


(All right, all right)
Follow your dreams and you will see
Anything you want you can achieve
(All right, all right)
Time to begin, fly like the wind
Breakin' down these walls you will be free


(All right, all right)
Follow your dreams and you will see
Anything you want you can achieve
(All right, all right)
Time to begin, fly like the wind
Breakin' down these walls you will be free
