Ohh
All the best things
They're never knockin' on my door
Ain't it good no more
Ain't it kickin' around (those strings ???)
I can't wait to take my place
When you're sealin' it all
With your domesticated deals
We all know,
Someone's always workin' it
Changin' like tomorrow never comes

Ain't gonna turn my back no more
Ain't gonna turn my back no more
All your learnin'
All your searchin'
All your work is done
Ain't gonna turn my back no more
Ain't gonna turn my back no more

You're the second one (8x)

OH, was it worth it
Hangin' up another day
Till someone go your way

Lost and lonely ain't no dream
My and yours or so it seems

Positively won my take...
But nobody speaking

Someone's always workin' it
Changin' like tomorrow never comes
Ain't gonna turn my back no more
Ain't gonna turn my back no more

All your learnin'
All your searchin'
All your work is done

Ain't gonna turn my back no more
Ain't gonna turn my back no more

You're the second one (8x)

Someone's always workin' it
Changin' like tomorrow never comes
Ain't gonna turn my back no more
Ain't gonna turn my back no more
All your learnin'
All your searchin'
All your work is done

Ain't gonna turn my back no more
Ain't gonna turn my back no more

You're the second one (over & over) 20x
