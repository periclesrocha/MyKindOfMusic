What can I do?

I want you addicted to me..

What in the world is a girl to do?
When in this smokey place I only see you
Was far away when you caught my eye
You've brought me back and now you're making me high

I was alone out there, with no one else around
Now I've fallen for you, and there's no coming down

Till there was you, I know what you're needing
My thoughts are leading, me straight into your eyes
What can I do? I'm looking right at you
This feeling is all new, I want you addicted to me

Fate can act in a curious way
When all that mattered means nothing today
All that concerns me, that drenches my thoughts
Is the sensation that seeing you brought

I was alone out there, with no one else around
Now I've fallen for you, and there's no coming down

And there's no coming down..

Till there was you.. What can I do..?

Till there was you, I know what you're needing
My thoughts are leading, me straight into your eyes
What can I do? I'm looking right at you
This feeling is all new, I want you addicted to me

And there's no coming down..
