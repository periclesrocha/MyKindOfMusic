I'm the same person as before
and I lead my life without change.
If someone were to ask I would still say the same.

{Chorus}
It's not a task it's just a dream
A dream that's so apart of me

When I think back to that day, my obsession to feel complete.
It's the same as I said before; it'll never leave me.

{Chorus}

It's not a task it's just a dream
A dream that's so apart of me
