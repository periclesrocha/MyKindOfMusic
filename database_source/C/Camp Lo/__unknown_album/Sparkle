We made the lyrics
Nigga gon' tell me how I did it

Lower, lower, lower, lower
Got the bubbly
Pourin through me
Got the bubbly
Pourin through me (sparkly)
Bubbly pourin through me
Got the bubbly
Pourin through me (sparkly)

(Sonny Cheeba)
Diamond runnin, strangers in paradise over flash
Sugar cane alley cats, Lo in parade
With the black spades, courvosier
Spillin on the rocks
Intoxicating the satin dogs
With his private bands

(Geechie Suede)
And it don't stop
To the midnight
This glass got me right
Only live lo light
Don't drown in the mo dawn
On to the disco
Sisco got me laced
Scorch a half a quart
Then E&J get chased
Bronx vigilantes, call us big willas
Diomond crook avengers, sheeba doll stealers

(Sonny Cheeba)
Give me sunshine dada
Have twenty one convictions solute
For the africaaner midnight express how we do
Hold my razors buku
Jiggas and figas of coolie faceded shadow boxers
Under cover faggot lovers
Dig my satin struthers
Coolie high ?? on the sky
Fro and the fly
Car wash bubble out
In a grand stand land
Gold day e'yday sip the slick and the 'stoute
Sticky self, sticky self
Bye-bye

(Geechie Suede)
Every district
Bring the mischief
Sing the sweet back
Blaze the schama, drop the vac, push the seat back
Diamante catch reflect off the chrome rim
Private stock drenched me, I can't stop from bubblin' (bubblin')
Ally cat anthem (anthem)
Always bless the instru (instru)
Jungle brown see smoke complete the Lo official (sparkly)
Got the bubbly (Loer)
Pourin through me (Loer)
Got the bubbly (Loer)
Pourin through me (Loer)
Sparkly
(repeat 4x)

(Geechie Suede)
Welcome to shadowin heaven
It's the seven layers of pleasure
My genuine draft with the Loer acurate measures
Precision on beats if your camp is wanted where ever
I'm bring in the vein, clappin rhythmes to stormy weather

(Sonny Cheeba)
Bro', kissin in quiet fire
Higher will get us lower
Staufer, she coffe diggin
Riggin' in shattered lifers
We only jive talkin
Razor keep cotton squawkin
Blazin the loose cannans
On top of white diomonds sands
Street corner symphonies spillin
Prisons are lower twistin
Brown Hornet keepin it nappy
Keep us on, keepin on

(Geechie Suede)
??...shades to black
Gleamin of the roof of the Ac
Don't know how to act
Wildin' with the non-chalant pack
Slappin the theives
With the unbelieves
That it be
Shakin your block
With the six million dollar bop
Just stop
The bloodclot tears
For years, we air-tight (tight)
On another flight
Until the farenheit (Harlem night)
Harlem night
I'm shakin your thoughts keepin the Lo blaze sharp for life
It's a jungle masquerade and we forever stone trife

(Sonny Cheeba)
That chick out the car commin from the island of ice
No contact with sheist bubblin with mr. midnight
And talkin in jive floatations
With cases
Of slick and shovelin herb hip tone
From black belt jones
The ebony junction'll
Be the function
Yo, dig it
Time to shake a leg, get up in your wig suga (sparkly)

Got the bubbly (Loer)
Pourin through me (Loer)
Got the bubbly (Loer)
Pourin through me
Sparkly
(repeat 3x)

Loer
Pourin through me
It's the Loer
Geechie Suede
It's the Loer
Sparkly
It's the Loer
With the Cheeba (get the drizzy on)
How we do it (get the drizzy on, get the drizzy on, it's the Loer)
Sparkly (ca-varsie, cavarsie)
Alright, alright
Yeah, get your drizzy on
How we flow, T
Get your drizzy on
Fled to tri-state
Get the drizzy on
Sparkly
Yeah, get the drizzy on, get the drizzy on, get the drizzy on
