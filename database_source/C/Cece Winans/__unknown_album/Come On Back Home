Since the beginning you knew
He's been with you
You were raised in the church
so you know I'm tellin the truth
Livin like you don't know right from wrong
tellin yourself you're okay
God's word is always right
Just admit you've left the way
So I'm here to tell ya
it doesn't matter what you've done or where you been
Just fall on your knees, confess and he will forgive your sins


Come on back home, you've been away too long
God has been good to you
He's brought you through and through
Why can't you see the signs
We're living at the end
Jesus is coming soon
Don't wait too late my friend

Just surrender and stop the fight
Go head and throw in the towel
Why run from love any longer
When you're almost out of time
Let him restore you
And break up that fallow ground
All power is in his hands
To turn your whole life around
Let him in your heart
The choice is yours you don't have to be ashamed



Please don't ignore the knocking at your door
Let him in your heart, he'll forget the past and give a fresh new start
And this time hold on, don't let him, don't let him, don't let him go
He wants to wash you and fill you and heal you and love you like...
