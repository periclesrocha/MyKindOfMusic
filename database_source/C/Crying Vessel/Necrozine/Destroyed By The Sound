[If you have a piece of information which is vital,
writing on your body instead of a piece of paper can be the answer.
It’s just a permanent way of keeping a note.]

I can feel you softly (I can feel you softly)
I can feel you softly (I can feel you softly)
I can feel you softly (I can feel you softly)
I can feel you softly (I can feel you softly)
I can feel you softly (I can feel you softly)

I can feel you softly (I can feel you softly)

She was my blossom
She didn’t have much to say
And I couldn’t help her
Then the sky turned gray
She left me two times
But we figured it out
Then I saw her coming
Destroyed by the sound

I can feel you softly (I can feel you softly)
I can feel you softly (I can feel you softly)
I can feel you softly (I can feel you softly)
I can feel you softly (I can feel you softly)
I can feel you softly (I can feel you softly)
I can feel you softly (I can feel you softly)
I can feel you softly (I can feel you softly)
I can feel you softly (I can feel you softly)

She was my blossom
She didn’t have much to say
And I couldn’t help her
Then the sky turned gray
She left me two times
But we figured it out
Then I saw her coming
Destroyed by the sound
