Empty your glass
Itâ€™s time to make love last, come on

Keeping your faith
Something to make you safe, come on (come on)

Hold yourself, save yourself from harm
Hold yourself, save yourself from harm
Until you rise above
This thing that we call love

Flying away
All you feel is pain that stays, come on

Trying to play
A game of love or hate, come on (come on)

Hold yourself, save yourself from harm
Hold yourself, save yourself from harm
Until you rise above
This thing that we call love
