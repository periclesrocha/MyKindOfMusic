The mountains are steep
And the valleys low
And already I'm weary
But I have so far to go
Oh, and sorrow holds my hand
And suff'ring sings me songs
But when I close my eyes
I know to Whom I belong
Who makes me strong

I will be free
I will be free to run the mountains
I will be free
Free to drink from the living fountain
Oh, I'll never turn back
'Cause He awaits for me
Oh, I will be free

A wise man, a rich man
In paupers' clothes
A shepherd to lead us
Through the land of woes
Though many battles I have lost
So many rivers yet to cross
But when my eyes behold the Son
Who bore my loss, Who paid the cost

Oh, I will be free
I will be free to run the mountains
I will be free
Oh, free to drink from the living fountain
Oh, I'll never turn back
'Cause He awaits for me
Oh, I will be free

Oh, oh, and I'll dance on silver moonlight
And I'll walk through velvet fields
Oh, and I'll run into the arms
The arms that set me free

Oh, I will be free to run the mountains
I will be free
Free to drink from the living fountain
Oh, I'll never turn back
'Cause He awaits
Oh, I'll never turn back
Don't you ever turn back
â€˜Cause someday, someday we're gonna see
That we will be free
