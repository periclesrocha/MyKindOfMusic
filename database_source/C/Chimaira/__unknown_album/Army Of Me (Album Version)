You can't - Understand I still have a lot to say
To you - A fortune nothing has left no time or place
My life - Upon my life there will always be lies
No more - I won't believe in this hypocrisy

You are - Parasitic bottom feeder
All you - Maggots you're one in the same, you all make me sick
Guilty - Especially you who justify your rational lives
Killing - You're killing in the name of God almighty

Cowards and crooks
Surrounded by liars, killers and haters
Cowards and crooks
Surrounded by liars, killers and haters
Cowards and crooks
Surrounded by liars, killers and haters
Cowards and crooks
I'm surrounded by filth

Army of me
It lives in us all
Army of me
It will avenge me
Army of me
It lives in us all
Army of me
It will avenge me

It will avenge me

Cowards and crooks
Surrounded by liars, killers and haters
Cowards and crooks
Surrounded by liars, killers and haters
Cowards and crooks
Surrounded by liars, killers and haters
Cowards and crooks
I'm surrounded by filth

Army of me
It lives in us all
Army of me
It will avenge me
Army of me
It lives in us all
Army of me
It will avenge me
