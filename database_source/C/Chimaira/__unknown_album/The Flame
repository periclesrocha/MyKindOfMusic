Her eyes opened
After that terrible night
Would she ever be the same
A revelation of her own demise
No one left but herself to blame

Her silence only fueled the flame
And now the angels have lost their wings
In daddy's playground
Nothing is what it seems

This was the last time
That he'd see her
That he'd touch her
That he'd make his little girl
Scream out loud

I'm gonna pound you into oblivion
I will make you fucking bleed
There is no escaping me
This is your destiny

I'm gonna pound you into oblivion
I will make you fucking bleed
There is no escaping me
This is your destiny

He came to her
Through the window again
The fan blowing to hide the noise
No hesitation from the devil inside
Everyone he touched was destroyed

His madness only fueled the flame

And now the angels
Have lost their wings
In daddy's playground
Nothing is what it seems

This was the last time
That he'd see her
That he'd touch her
That he'd make his little girl
Scream out loud

I'm gonna pound you into oblivion
I will make you fucking bleed
There is no escaping me
This is your destiny

Time to walk with me
Time to walk with me
Time to die!

Let me take you somewhere secluded
Where only the trees can see
If I can't have you, no one will
Didn't you know it was always me?

Your flame now burned out
You were daddy's little girl
Your flame now burned out
Oh god, what have I done?

Oh god... what have I done?
