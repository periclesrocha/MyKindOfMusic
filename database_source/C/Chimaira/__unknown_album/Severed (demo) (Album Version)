Stay awake to decide
Are you coming back?
Is this my sanity?
I can't forgive

Oh, is it the same to me?
I can't take your place
I'll never see you, never flee from me
Severed

Lost lies in the house I bring
I can't fucking see
I can never pull yourself from me
I can't focus

Libertine my "said to be"
I will never save you
Wait...today is not the same
Severed
