Raccoons in the trash, a voice on the breeze
The fits and the screams when you were only thirteen
You had the attic room
You heard the whole thing

Under the slanted ceiling your dad painted blue
Whatever happened to you
Only the worst could be assumed
You're dreaming often of the attic room

In other rooms with other boys
Under other ceilings
The springs and the sighs
May drown another night

But you wake up shaking and all that's new
Is the owner of the arm around you
How could he know what to do
He never had the attic room
