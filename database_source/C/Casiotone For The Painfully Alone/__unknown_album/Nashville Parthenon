If you ever make it back to Nashville
Remember you have still got a friend
I'll meet you at the Parthenon
That's the place we always went

It's been so dull since you left Nashville
I've read the same books again & again
It makes me wish I wasn't bashful
When it comes to other men

But if I could have my way
Darling you'd come home

Remember when you moved to Nashville
And the first time that we kissed
Remember when your mother found us
Remember that you're sorely missed

And when you make it back to Nashville
We'll forget all of your sins
And I still buy two pairs of everything
So when you come home you & I'll be twins

Because if I could have my way
I wouldn't be alone
