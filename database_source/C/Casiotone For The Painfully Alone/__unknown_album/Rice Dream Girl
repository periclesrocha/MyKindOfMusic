I was in the safeway store when I saw you in aisle four
I swear you looked so nice, you were buying milk that was made out of rice
I tried to think of something clever to say but you were already walking away
In an attempt to get my groove on I offered you my white castle coupon

The radio was playing seal, I tried to tell you how I feel
But then our shopping carts locked wheels and the moment just seemed wrong

Oh, won't you do what's right, put your groceries in my car tonight
I want to take you home
Oh, with your eyes of blue I want to drink rice milk with you
I'll be your one and only, so we won't be so lonely
