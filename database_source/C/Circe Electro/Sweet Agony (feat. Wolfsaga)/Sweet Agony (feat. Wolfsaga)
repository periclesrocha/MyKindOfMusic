(Sweet agony)
(Sweet agony)
(Sweet agony)
(Sweet agony)
(Sweet agony)
(Sweet agony)

Slipping inside, into the dark
Wondering why you do what I ask
Look into my eyes
Look into my eyes and see

Death is sweet life now undone
Giving in to me isn’t so hard won
Look into my eyes
Look into my eyes and see

Don’t resist the love we feel
The pain is pleasure and it’s just as real

Sweet agony
Sweet sweet agony

Kiss my lips and taste goodbye
Poisoned milk like a lullaby
Look into my eyes
Look into eyes and see

Death is sweet life now undone
Giving in to me isn’t so hard won
Look into my eyes
Look into my eyes and see

Don’t resist the love we feel
The pain is pleasure and it’s just as real

Sweet agony
Sweet agony
Sweet agony
Sweet agony

Kiss my lips and taste goodbye

Sweet sweet agony
Sweet sweet agony
Sweet sweet agony
Sweet sweet agony
