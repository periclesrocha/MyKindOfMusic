Something's wrong, my mind is gone.
It won't be long before I lose it made.
I will crawl into my soul to
Find a way to escape this
Sorry world.
Don't take offense by my
Cold-hearted nature
I can't escape the dreams of my head
And where is the voice of yesterday's cries
Take me away from all your lies.
CHORUS:
I don't wanna be here
For the rest of my life
I don't wanna be here
Something's wrong...I don't belong here
Staring at the people, they talk about
Whispering words to spite my passion
I'll move on maybe I'll live in chance
Now it don't make sense why you're
Just like the rest
It's easy to see I am the one you attest
Oh this awful life has a change as the hours
As you pass before my eyes
CHORUS
Downtown isn't the future there
All of my repsect for you go get washed away
Now that you've come back to me
You give yourself,
That's all that I need.
CHORUS
You know I'll be here
You know I'll be here
