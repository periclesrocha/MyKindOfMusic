How I miss that old-fashioned Christmas
Carols being sung by the tree
Window's candlelight shining bright
For the whole world to see

Children's eyes of sweet expectations
Wondering what each present will hold
Lying in their beds and impatient
On long Christmas Eves of old

It used to be that all the family
Would gather for this one night
It used to be that special feeling
Shared together knowing
Christmas was here
One night a year

How I miss that old-fashioned Christmas
Memories that last through the years
Call me sentimental, don't mind if you do
I wish an old fashioned Christmas to you
