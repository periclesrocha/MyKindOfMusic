The prisons are empty
The homeless have houses
Nobody's hungry
Nobody's poor
Nobody's judged by their faith or their color
Nobody's wrong in this world without war
We buried our swords
We don't fight anymore

You can't imagine all the mountains we'd move if we loved
If we loved a little harder
Yea, there's no telling all the walls we'd break through
If we loved
If we loved a little harder

Nobody's lonely, used, or neglected
Children are cherished from the day that they're born
Even a stranger's never a stranger
No bars on the windows
No locks on our doors
Cuz we open our doors
Not afraid anymore

You can't imagine all the mountains we'd move if we loved
If we loved a little harder
Yea, there's no telling all the walls we'd break through
If we loved
If we loved a little harder

Just think of how much better off we'd be
If we open up our hearts
If we believe

You can't imagine all the mountains we'd move if we loved
If we loved a little harder
Yea, there's no telling all the walls we'd break through
If we loved
If we loved a little harder
Ohhhhh
If we loved
If we loved
