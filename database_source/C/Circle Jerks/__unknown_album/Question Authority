question authority
have they the right to say how it should be?
should one man be able to write it all down?
when half the time he can't tell right from wrong

question authority
another mans law is not right for me
another lie to bleed my sympathy
another time there will be no pitty

is this what you wan to see?
is this the way you want things to be?

question authority
i'll pay the price the future belongs to me
this is the time
this is the hour
the worlds our dowery
the glory and the power

is this what you wan to see?
is this the way you want things to be?
things to be,things to be
question authority...
