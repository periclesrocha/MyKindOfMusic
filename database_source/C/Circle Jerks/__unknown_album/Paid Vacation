I hope you're having fun
Where's your uniform? where's your gun?
Better rub up that suntan lotion
'cause you'll be fighting in the hot sun

It's not..vietnam
It's another oil company scam
Salute that flag of uncle sam
Get your money out place your bets
It's afghanistan!!
Fix bayonets,check grenades
Got enough bullets
Got enough rounds to wipe out this place
We're the infantry & cavalry
Parachutes fill the skies and bodies burn and people die
