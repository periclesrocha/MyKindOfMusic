My eyes are jaded and complicated
Tired of the liars and the masqueraded
Stealing our innocence away
Like a thief in the night

Who took away our faith in what we know to be right?

That was another world then
That was another time

You can never go back to the scene of a perfect crime
Well you can never go back to the scene of a perfect crime

Whatever became of the child I was
You know I never wanna lose her
And I won’t give her up
Now my heart is harder
And my skin is getting tougher and tougher (tougher)

That was another world then
That was another time

You can never go back to the place where love is blind
Well you can never go back to the scene of a perfect crime

Whatever became of our sweet blind love
As long as we could be together it was more than enough
Now we’re all grown up and we need so much
I never knew that the price would go up as such

That was another world then
That was another time

Well you can never go back to the place where love is blind
Well you can never go back to the place where love is blind
Well you can never go back to the place where love is blind, oh
(blind, blind, blind)
You can never go back to the scene of a perfect crime
