Anesthetizing, Synthesizing, Mechanizing, Energizing.
Fear inflicted by glimmers of fate, transformed by
Lies we hear, spawned from the wombs of hate, Bring
Forth the energy. Lies the building blocks of fact,
Which manifest in cries, ring out and forge attack,
Bring forth the energy. Turbocharger. Fight, conquer
The weak, command the sheep and flex your might, the
Power is in hand, Bring forth the energy. Thrash,
Pound the face of deceit, just close your fist and
Smash, the trends we will defeat, Bring forth the
Energy. Turbocharger.
