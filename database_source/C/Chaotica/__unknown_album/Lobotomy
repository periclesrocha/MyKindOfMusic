You stupid sheep open your eyes, He's not a lamb but a
Wolf in disguise. He'll lead you all to the edge of
The hill, He will say "jump"and I know you all will.
You follow blindly 'till the end of the line, You look
Around and there's nothing but swine. You trust his
Lies 'cause they're easy to hear, You gave all your
Faith now your faith disappeared. Frontal Lobotomy.
Invent your god; put your faith in the sky, But you're
Sill worried if you're trusting a lie. You pray so
Hard and you claim he talks back, But I hear voices
Too after I smoke some crack. Hypocrisy - the way of
The man, Away from the truth is the way that you ran.
The holy priest engaging in sodomy, To find truth have
A frontal lobotomy. Frontal Lobotomy.
