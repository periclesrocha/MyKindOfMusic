I’m coming up roses now, flying high
No-one can touch me as I wave goodbye
I’m tall as a willow baby, tall as a willow
I’m sure not sorry for that

You wouldn’t believe the stuff I know
and have collected

I’m hung up on breathing now when I want
No one can hurt me when I’m in trouble
I’m strong as I’m mellow baby, strong as I’m mellow
I sure am happy for that

Have you ever seen the things I own
And have neglected?
They’re all quite strange and unconnected
And that’s why they’re strong

A mile is long when home is far away
(Coming up roses now, flying high)
A mile is long when home is far away
(Coming up roses now…)
Home is far away

I’m holding the fiddle now, playing hard
I’ve learnt my lesson in self-composure
I shout and I bellow baby, shout and I bellow
Can you hear me out back?

Can you feel the way I’ve grown
And disconnected?

A mile is long when home is far away
(Coming up roses now, flying high)
A mile is long when home is far away
(Coming up roses now, flying high)
A mile is long when home is far away
(The night is long, the day is long)
(The night is long, the day is long)
A mile is long when home is far away

Home is far away

(The night is long, the day is long)
(The night is long, the day is long)

A first thought came to the sound
(The night is long, the day is long)
And it filled itself with spectrum
So it can see from the back of its head

Feel the beat fall in
Did that despite me
Throw me off the scent
Feel the beat fall in

A beast at the core of its nature
A beast at the core of its nature
