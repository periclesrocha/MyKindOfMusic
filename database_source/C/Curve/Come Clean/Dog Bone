It doesn’t matter
No one’s bothered
If you do it
With one another

You only call when I’m alone
Dog bone, dog bone, dog bone
Act like a dog without a home
Dog bone, dog bone, dog bone

Oh yeah
Oh yeah

You’ve never wondered
Far from my side
When you’ve pondered
If I’m your bride
You’ll try
But there’ll be no surprises to this

You only call when I’m alone
Dog bone, dog bone, dog bone
Act like a dog without a home
Dog bone, dog bone, dog bone
You only call when I’m alone
Dog bone, dog bone, dog bone

I think of you
And all you’ve shown
And I will never be
What you are

You only call when I’m alone
Dog bone, dog bone, dog bone
Act like a dog without a home
Dog bone, dog bone, dog bone
You only call when I’m alone
Dog bone, dog bone, dog bone
Act like a dog without a home
Dog bone, dog bone, dog bone

Oh yeah
