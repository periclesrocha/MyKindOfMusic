My tiled white floor
Seems so soothing
It’s so inviting
So don’t ask questions

’Cause my nose is bleeding
But all’s forgiven
It’s so inviting
And it don’t ask questions

How’ve I been living?
You already know
Seen it all before
You sat and watched me grow

Everyone lies around you
From deep inside
Nothing seems to undermine you
No need to hide
You’re only what you know (only what you know)
Only what you know (only what you know)
Only what you know

My stained white dress
Tells a story
It flows with humour
And it laughs at reason

That’s how I’ve been living
But you already know
You’ve seen it all before
Or so you tell me so

Everyone lies around you
From deep inside
Nothing seems to undermine you
No need to hide
You’re only what you know (only what you know)
Only what you know (only what you know)
Only what you know

Now we’ve come to the end
I never thought we’d get this far
It’s not so clever for someone like you
You could do better

Everyone lies around you
From deep inside
Nothing seems to undermine you
No need to hide
You’re only what you know (only what you know)
Only what you know (only what you know)
Only what you know
