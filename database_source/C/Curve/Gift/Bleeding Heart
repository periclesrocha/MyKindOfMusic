Hear my heart, how it’s been beating
It’s taken steps it can never retreat in

Safe and warm
Now it has meaning

You can’t ever go back
You can’t ever go back
You can’t beat on the door
You can’t ever go back
You can’t care anymore
You can’t care anymore
You know what it’s for
You can’t care anymore

Watch my tongue and its cruel deleting
It’s eaten words that it used to scream in

You can’t ever go back
You can’t ever go back
You can’t beat on the door
You can’t ever go back
It’s not the same anymore
It’s not the same anymore
You know what’s for
You can’t care anymore

See my heart, how it’s been bleeding
See my heart, how it’s been bleeding

Should have seen it coming
Should have done something
Should have seen it coming
Should have done something
Should have seen it coming
Should have done something
Should have seen it coming
Should have done something
Should have seen it coming
Should have seen it coming
Should have seen it coming
Should have seen it coming
Should have seen it coming
Should have seen it coming
Should have seen it coming
Should have seen it coming

Should have done something
Should have done something
Should have done something
Should have done something
