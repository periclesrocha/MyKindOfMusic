All this time I’ve had my eyes closed (eyes closed)
I didn’t see you for who you are (who you are)
My mistake, I should know better (better)
But I’ve learnt nothing, I’m not secure (not secure)
Will you tell me in a conversation (conversation)
I can’t accept that we don’t talk (that we don't talk)

But that’s my problem: I want it all
Ye, that’s my problem: I want it all

Curious and eager to know
Curious and eager to know
What every good girl knows
What every good girl knows

Years drag by without a flicker (flicker)
There’s no affection, just remorse (just remorse)
All this hate for one another (for one another)
I guess our time has ran its course (ran its course)

But that’s the problem: there is no more
Ye, that’s the problem: there is no more

Curious and eager to know
Furious with nothing to show (to show)
Curious and eager to know
Furious with nothing to show (to show)

What every good girl shows
What every good girl knows
What every good girl shows
What every good girl knows

Eager
Eager
Eager
Eager

I’m just scared I can’t talk to you
About what worries me
Even though you want me too
I want to share
If you had the time
But what’s the point
’Cause time isn’t mine
Understand I’m not upset
About who you are
And the image you set
I live in the shadow of your fame
You need to know I love you
But I need the same

Curious and eager to know
Furious with nothing to show (to show, to show)
Curious and eager to know
Furious with nothing to show (to show, to show, to show, to show, to show…)

Curious and eager to know
Furious with nothing to show (to show, to show)
Curious and eager to know
Furious with nothing to show (to show, to show, to show, to show, to show…)
