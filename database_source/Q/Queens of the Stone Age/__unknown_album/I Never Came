When you say it's dead and gone
Yes, I know you're wrong
Cut and slash, sharpest knife
It won't die
Poison cup, drank it up
It won't die
No fire, no gun, no rope, no stone
It won't die

Why you gotta shove it in my face
As if you put me in my place?
'Cause I don't care if you or me is wrong or right
Ain't gonna spend another night
In your bed
In your bed

Laws of man are just pretend
They ain't mine
Love so good, love so bad
It won't die
Some talk too long, they know it all
I just smile and move on

Words ain't free, like you and me
I don't mind

Why'd you have to be so mean and cruel?
The dogs are loose, I'm on to you
You ball and chained together from the dawn to dusk
Can't call it leavin', 'cause it's just
I never came
I never came
I never came
I never came
I never came
I never came
